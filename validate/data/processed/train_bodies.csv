844,"This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull temporarily counteracting the Earths own gravity and making people virtually weightless, Astronomers have long been aware that there would be an alignment of the planets on that date when Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune and Pluto would be on the same side of the sun within an arc 95° wide, Moore told scientists that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the air at the precise moment the alignment occurred, But now they are guaranteeing the occurrence as the gravitational effect of the other planets on the Earths crust is maximum even at their closest approach, But if you jump in the air at 947 AM PST on January 4 2015 it should take you about 3 seconds to land back on your feet instead of the usual 02 seconds, If they do so he promised they would experience a strange floating sensation, If you think you will be able to float around your house you are wrong"
