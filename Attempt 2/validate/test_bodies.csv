1668,Major Mariam Al Mansouri became the United Arab Emirates first female pilot on the ISIS terrorist group terrorist group following the announcement that the United States would be leading a coalition of nations to use airstrikes against the Islamic State. While the world celebrates her success the war has come home for Mansouri and reports are claiming the female fight pilots family has officially disowned her. In a related report by The Inquisitr the 35 year old Major Mariam Al Mansouri was among three other women that were part of the attack on ISIS. She graduated in January of 2008 and she said that being a military almost entirely dominated by men was a dream she is held for years. It was my aspiration. Ever since I finished high school I wanted to learn flying because it was something that I liked in the first place. Being in the air force is a responsibility. I feel proud especially that I am part of the first batch. And that encourages me to continue in this field. As a pilot you have to study all the time even after graduation. You have to continue training because the more hours you fly the more experience you accumulate. Mansouri led three other UAE F 16 pilots in the first airstrike and it is said that when the US tanker pilots called in for air refueling and asked for the UAE mission and when they heard a female voice on the other side they paused for 20 seconds. They then proceeded to drop bombs this week in coordinated attacks against Islamic State strongholds near Raqqa Aleppo and Idlib. Unfortunately an Arabic language news site called WattanTV is reporting that Mariam Al Mansouris family has disowned her for these actions. Please keep in mind this is a Google translation and is extremely rough. The Inquisitr did attempt to clean up the translation but it is possible there were translation errors introduced in the process. The Mansouri family in the UAE announced Wednesday that they had Nbaraha untranslated of her daughter Mary because of her participation in the international coalition led by the United States to strike at civilian targets inside Syrian territory. The family also stressed their support for the Syrian revolution. The Mansouri family said in a statement published by news sites Arabic…. We are the sons of the family of al Mansuri in the United Arab Emirates announce to fill the innocence translation error. of the so called Mariam Al Mansouri. We remind anyone who participates in international aggression on the Syrian people led by the daughter of the rogue Mariam Al Mansouri that the the Islamic State in the East and the West has a duty to defend issues of the nation. We exhort the jihad for the sake of Allah and the support of the Syrian Revolution. Blessed in the face of the descendants of Ibn Alqami. The Mansouri family also called for support for the Syrian revolution calling for all factions and battalions operating on the scene Shamiyah to unite and join forces and efforts to a single goal which is to drop the Assad regime. The family also appears to have announced support specifically for the ISIS terrorist organization saying that their family is honored heroes of the Sunnis in Iraq and the Levant. The ISIS terrorist group is also known as ISIL which stands for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant although it is possible this similarity to the ISIS name may be a Google translation error

73,Last Tuesday College Humor posted a photo series titled This Is The Most Passive Aggressive Office Battle we have Ever Seen depicting an exchange of break room notes that escalates into a full scale sandwich hostage crisis. It was pretty funny but also totally fake as made clear by the extensive watermarks and CH Staff byline an attribution the site reserves for original works like last years phony Breaking Bad finale script. The obvious joke was not quite as obvious however when someone cropped out the College Humor watermarks and posted the images on Reddit the bottomless well from which all deadline facing bloggers drink. From there the clearly staged photos were picked up far and wide earning credulous coverage from the Daily Mail the Mirror and Fox 32 Chicago which ran the headline Lunch theft prompts ransom note from sandwich thief. When those news organizations did try to credit the pictures they generally cited the Facebook page of a New Zealand radio station which—as most non journalists could probably tell you—is not a real source. But probably the funniest write up of all came from Rupert Murdochs Newscomau. Beware the sandwich thief cautioned the News Corp subsidiary apparently unable to heed their own warning
2392,SHE made headlines around the world when she revealed she paid thousands of dollars to get a third breast surgically attached to her chest. But now Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil is facing claims that the surgery is a fake and she made it all up. The claims come as an American news channel 10 News revealed Tridevil who goes by the real name Alisha Jasmine Hessler had filed an incident report after losing a three breast prosthesis earlier this month. Tridevil filed the report after her bag was stolen from Tampa International Airport on September 16 with the report also obtained by TMZ. The luggage which was stolen allegedly contained a fake breast and 10 News obtained the report which listed the missing contents including a 3 breasts prothesis. However Tridevil claims she underwent her surgery a few months ago and it cost 20000. Internet rumour site Snopes also uncovered her JasmineTridevilcom site is registered to Alisha Hessler someone who Tridevil bares striking resemblance to. However when 10 News reporter Charles Bill tracked her down Tridevil insisted her surgery and third breast were the real deal. I figured people would be sceptical but it is true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show she said. Tridevil insisted the surgery went ahead and she tried 50 60 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery. Surgeons have also dismissed the possibility of it being real. New York plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman told The Daily Dot I believe 100 per cent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for he said. I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible. Michigan surgeon Dr Anthony Youn agreed while the surgery was possible it was highly unlikely anyone would perform it. In a YouTube clip Tridevil said the extra breast felt like her other two but that the only difference is the nipple which she had to get tattooed on. The 21 year old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around. She also said her surgery was documented by a film crew and will prove her story is true The Mirror reported. Tridevil has received plenty of venom on social media and just hours ago posted Pain is temporary glory is forever from her Facebook page. Just an hour earlier she wrote do not be afraid to be different that is what makes you beautiful and also posted a photo of her pre surgery which won her a host of compliments and questions as to why she would want to change. Omg. I done know what is happening but I am seriously going viral right now it is not the first time Ms Hessler has made headlines. Last year she chose to publicly humiliate a man who beat her instead of sending him to prison. She said she was introduced to the man when friends of hers invited him out clubbing last December and he beat her after unwanted sexual advances. She received hospital treatment and a police report was filed. But instead of pressing charges she offered her attacker an ultimatum telling him I can either press charges and have you arrested for a year or I can have you sit outside at a busy intersection for 8 hours holding up a sign that says I beat women
1088,—The cardiac arrest leading to Joan Rivers death happened as the comedians personal doctor began performing a biopsy on her vocal cords a source close to the death investigation told CNN. JOAN RIVERS THROUGH THE YEARS Joan Rivers blurb Joan Rivers has passed away at the age of 81. Take a look at the life of the legendary comedienne. MORE CELEBRITIES PAY TRIBUTE TO JOAN RIVERS Joan Rivers last show Celebrities took to social media to share their thoughts about comedian Joan Rivers death. Take a look at some of the tributes posted to Twitter. MORE A staff member at Manhattans Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators that the doctor who has not been publicly identified took a selfie photo in the procedure room while Rivers was under anesthesia the source said. Rivers 81 was at the clinic for a scheduled endoscopy by another doctor gastroenterologist Dr Lawrence Cohen. That procedure intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat involved the insertion of a camera down her throat. After Cohen the clinics medical director finished his work a biopsy was done on Rivers without her prior consent according to the source. An ear nose and throat specialist not certified by the clinic as required by law performed a biopsy on her vocal cords. The doctor is described by the source as Rivers personal ear nose throat physician. Even though you are a licensed physician you still should have if you will the checks and balances to get your approval to practice in that particular place said Dr Arthur Caplan a medical ethicist at New York Universitys Langone Medical Center. Investigators believe that Rivers vocal chords began to swell during the allegedly unauthorized biopsy cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs which led to cardiac arrest on the morning of August 29 the source said. Rivers 81 was rushed by paramedics from Yorkville Endoscopy to New Yorks Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away where she died a week later. Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement last Thursday denying reports that any vocal cord biopsy has ever been done at the clinic although federal privacy law prevented any patient information from being released. The day after the denial was issued the clinic confirmed that Dr Cohen is not currently performing procedures nor is he currently serving as medical director. The source said that at this time neither Cohen nor the ear nose and throat doctor have been accused of wrongdoing by investigators. The clinic declined to respond to the sources comments about a biopsy or a selfie citing federal privacy law
1147,Version 82 of Apples iOS mobile operating system could launch as soon as Monday with new and improved health features in tow. that is the same day the company is expected to unveil more details on its Apple Watch. The maker of the iPhone and iPad mobile gadgets was close to releasing iOS 82 to the public earlier blog Boy Genius Report said on Thursday but instead decided to push out one final build to employees and testers. The change log for that build reveals several new features and enhancements in the health department as well as a host of bug fixes according to BGR. The Apple Watch faces an increasingly competitive market already crowded with devices from other players. To entice a wide range of buyers Apple designed its first wearable as both a smartwatch and a health and fitness monitor. So the health features baked into iOS 8 need to be solid if Apple hopes to capture the fitness crowd. Based on the change log the new and improved health features in iOS 82 add the ability to select the unit of measurement for body temperature weight height distance and blood glucose improve stability when dealing with large amounts of data include the ability to add and visualize workout sessions from third party apps address an issue that may have prevented users from adding a photo in Medical ID fix units for vitamins and minerals fix an issue where health data would not refresh after changes in data source order fix an issue where some graphics showed no data values and add a privacy setting that enables turning off tracking of steps distance and flights climbed. But iOS 82 is also designed as a bug squasher. Life has not exactly been easy for Apples iOS 8 since it launched last September. The initial version carried a few bugs that were supposed to be resolved a week later in iOS 801. But that edition came with even more bugs prompting Apple to quickly pull it and launch 802. Since then Apple has rolled out versions 81 812 and 813 all with some enhancements and bug fixes. The bugs and multiple releases may account for the sluggish adoption of iOS 8 which has trailed that of its predecessor but is finally up to 75 percent of all devices that visited the App Store as of last Monday. According to BGR the bug fixes address an issue in Maps that prevented navigating to some favorite locations address an issue where the last word in a quick reply message was not autocorrected fix an issue where duplicate iTunes purchased content could prevent iCloud restore from completing resolve an issue where some music or playlists did not sync from iTunes to the Music app fix an issue where deleted audiobooks sometimes remained on the device resolve an issue that could prevent call audio from routing to car speakers while using Siri Eyes Free fix a Bluetooth calling issue where no audio is heard until the call is answered fix a timezone issue where Calendar events appear in GMT address an issue that caused certain events in a custom reoccurring meeting to drop from Exchange calendar fix a certificate error that prevented configuring an Exchange account behind a third party gateway fix an issue that could cause an organizers Exchange meeting notes to be overwritten and resolve an issue that prevented some Calendar events from automatically showing as busy after accepting an invite. The update also promises greater stability for Mail Music the Flyover feature in Maps VoiceOver reliability and Connectivity with Made for iPhone Hearing Aids. A spokeswoman for Apple declined CNETs request for comment. But you can learn more about the Apple Watch and see if iOS 82 really will launch Monday by tuning in to CNETs live blog and show starting at 9 am PT Monday
799,ISIL has released a second video allegedly showing the beheading of journalist Steven Sotloff according to SITE Intelligence Group. The terrorist group had previously claimed Sotloff would be killed if the US continued to attack in Iraq in a video released Aug 19. That threat came in the same video where journalist James Foley was executed by the same group. The new video allegedly also threatens David Cawthorne Haines a British hostage. The Wire spoke with Joe Cleffie of SITE to gather more information about the video which the group found on one of the jihadi forums. We would not send it out without verifying it Cleffie offered. it is him being beheaded. SITE has transcribed the video on its website. In the video Sotloff says he is paying the price for US intervention in Iraq while the same masked fighter who appeared in the video of Foley stands behind him and states the following I am back Obama and I am back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State because of your insistence on continuing your bombings and unclear on Mosul Dam despite our serious warnings. You Obama have but to gain from your actions but another American citizen. So just as your missiles continue to strike our people our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people We take this opportunity to warn those governments that enter this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State to back off and leave our people alone. Below is a transcript of Sotloffs statement in the video I am Steven Joel Sotloff. I am sure you know exactly who I am by now and why I am appearing before you. And now this time for my message Obama your foreign policy of intervention in Iraq was supposed to be for the preservation of American lives and interests so why is it that I am paying the price of your interference with my life. Am I not an American citizen. you have spent billions of US tax payers dollars and we have lost thousands of our troops in our previous fighting against the Islamic State so where is the peoples interest in reigniting this war. From what little I know about foreign policy I remember a time you could not win an election without promising to bring our troops back home from Iraq and Afghanistan and to close down Guantanamo. Here you are now Obama nearing the end of your term and having achieving none of the above and deceivingly marching us the American people in the blazing fire. Sotloff had disappeared while reporting in Syria in August 2013. Following his appearance in the video of Foleys beheading Sotloffs mother Shirley issued a video plea to ISIL leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi asking for her sons return. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said during his daily briefing Tuesday he had not seen the video or the reports of Sotloffs death. He noted the US military effort to rescue Sotloff and Foley in July which failed when the hostages were not at the location they targeted. Our thoughts and prayers first and foremost are with Mr Sotloff and his family Earnest said. He added that he was not in a position to confirm the authenticity of the latest video. Any new video he said would be analyzed very carefully by the US government and its intelligence officials to determine its authenticity. According to BBC British Prime Minister David Cameron has also condemned the video Just before 2 pm The Wire received the video showing which reportedly shows the assassination of Steven Sotloff. Please note this description of the video is graphic. The video which is extremely graphic in nature was edited in a manner similar to the beheading video of James Foley. The beginning of the video shows President Obama speaking in regards to ISIL and airstrikes several weeks ago. In the next scene Sotloff introduces himself. Sotloff appears with similarly short hair as Foley did in his video and with a beard. He is in a similar desert area wearing the same orange robe as Foley. The area in which this is filmed is extremely windy unlike Foleys environment during the beheading video. After Sotloffs brief statement the executioner speaks and is shown putting the knife to Sotloffs neck. However just like the Foley video the murder scene is edited. The video shows only the knife being held up and then the decapitated body positioned in the same manner as Sotloffs. Once again a very short dagger rather than a long blade is used. The blade may be the same as in the first video. This differs greatly from traditional ISIL execution videos which have circulated the web. The end of the video shows a British man David Cawthrone Haines. The executioner briefly stands next to Haines grabbing his shirt before releasing him and stepping to the side. The video then turns black and white quite blurry before ending. The executioner does not hold a knife when showing Haines and there may be a slight murmur of background noise from others before the video ends. Of particular note are three major edits the black screens introducing each part of the video the editing out of Sotloffs executioner and the executioners voice. The voice sounds as though it may have been manipulated after the video was shot. While the man in the video appears similar to Foleys executioner he sounds slightly deeper and more computerized. In the first video the voice is being used to identify the executioner and this may be the reason for the change in this second video. This story is developing
439,An unconfirmed explosion at a Saudi Arabian oil pipeline briefly sent crude prices higher on Wednesday but the market shrugged off the scare signalling once again traders concerns over falling demand. Pictures of the blast at a small domestic pipeline near Riyadh were posted on Twitter sending prices of North Sea crude up almost 2 within minutes before the benchmark fell back to its previous trading range. Brent had been trading down around 05pc at just over 82 per barrel before the blast. Saudi Arabia is the worlds largest exporter of crude and has the capacity to pump up to 125m barrels per day of oil. The kingdom is the most influential member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries as it accounts for about a third of the groups supplies. The unconfirmed pipeline blast follows a period of violence in Saudi Arabias volotile Eastern Province where much of its oil is produced. Masked men are understood to have killed at least five people earlier this week in a Shiite village near the town of Qatif which is a predominantly Shia area of the Sunni Muslim controlled kingdom. Some traders believe that Saudi is willing to tolerate lower oil prices partly to defend the kingdoms share of the energy market in the US the worlds largest economy. The largest and most influential Opec producer seems more interested in defending its market shares in an oversupplied market as well as wishing to curb the shale oil supply flooding the market from the US said Commerzbank. To this end Saudi Arabia is evidently prepared to accept lower oil prices for a certain period of time. Oil back close to 82 a barrel after Saudi blast.

2368,More details are emerging in the death of Joan Rivers which occurred when the 81 year old went into cardiac arrest during what was supposed to be a routine throat procedure at the Upper East Sides Yorkville Endoscopy clinic. According to CNN the comedians personal doctor took a selfie in the operating room while Rivers was under anesthesia and also performed a biopsy on her vocal cords without her prior consent. Yorkvilles medical director Lawrence Cohen who has since been let go from his post was the one originally performing the endoscopy on Rivers. It is believed Cohen then stepped aside to let Rivers personal doctor — who was not authorized to practice at the clinic — perform the unauthorized biopsy that ultimately caused her to go into cardiac arrest. The doctor named in these accusations has yet to be identified
806,Like most other places with people Lima Peru has a surplus of men who pass those crucial moments throughout their work day by sexually harassing women in the streets. Everlast the brand you had no clue was this fierce actually did something about it. They filmed men catcalling their own mothers. Everlast tracked down the mothers of their very scummy spawn and got them on board for a worthwhile mission shame your son by getting him to accidentally catcall you. Everlast gave these moms makeovers wigs manicures the whole thing. Then they sent these women out all dressed up like all the other desperate women who wear dresses out in public so that they could be magnets for pervy lines like where are you going can I come. Predictably this video shows the sons saying dirty stuff to their own mothers in disguise but it does not stop there. In the typically charming way we are all so enchanted with one dude calls his own mom piggy. Another says tasty panties. that is when the most satisfying part happens. The mothers turn around for the reveal and bitch these men out. So this is one chance encounter with a lady in the street they will not forget. The glorious leader of this effort who is wearing fingerless Everlast driving gloves wants the moms to slap these scoundrels but watching them freak out is even more gratifying. Even if it is not real it is required viewing for all men with female relatives. It could have been trite to have moms help their sons see the light by subjecting them to street harassment. It might have been corny if Everlast gave these dudes a chance to redeem themselves. But these boss women offered no such opportunity. They were on a war path to make their sons pay. In one screaming session they express all the anger you have felt every time you had to deal with sex invites in the morning. it is a pretty genius way to turn the tables on the catcallers. At least it is definitely more effective than issuing a friendly card explaining why it is not polite to express interest in a strangers underwear. One of the guys explains to his mommy that it was not him saying those nasty things. Iron clad alibis like this are best handled by a raging mother in heels. Freud may have already died but now he is literally dying over this. Watch this glorious victory with the English translation below. Reddit

In the video which appeared online today Sotloff addresses the camera saying I am sure you know exactly who I am by now and why I am appearing.

2554,Donald Trumps intentions regarding US participation in the Paris climate deal remained unknown on Sunday as one report cited confidants saying the president had made up his mind to pull out while a senior cabinet figure said he was quite certain the president is wide open on this issue. Trump said in a tweet on Saturday I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week. The message was published as Trump left Sicily after the G7 summit. Leaders of the other G7 nations – Germany France Britain Italy Canada and Japan – issued a communique confirming their support for the climate deal which was reached with contributions from Barack Obama in 2015 and signed the following year. A report from the Axios news outlet however cited three sources with direct knowledge as saying Trump had told confidants including the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt that he plannned to pull the US out of the deal. In an interview broadcast on CBSs Face the Nation meanwhile defense secretary James Mattis said the White House had obviously got a discussion going on about our policy in this regard. He added And I was sitting in on some of the discussions in Brussels by the way where climate change came up and the president was open he was curious about why others were in the position they were in … and I am quite certain the president is wide open on this issue as he takes in the pros and cons of that accord. Mattis said that as defense secretary such negotiations were not inside my portfolio but added Obviously we deal with the aspects of a warming climate in the Department of Defense and to us that is just another one of the many factors we deal with which we call the physical environment. The White House did not immediately respond to media requests for comment. On Sunday morning however the president offered comment of his own via Twitter that might have been aimed at the anonymous sources cited in the Axios report. It is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the FakeNews media the president wrote. Whenever you see the words sources say in the fake news media and they do not mention names it is very possible that those sources do not exsist sic but are made up by fake news writers. FakeNews is the enemy
820,A new law in Saudi Arabia banning tempting eyes has become the latest example of female oppression in the country. The law which states that women with alluring eyes will be forced to wear a full veil has been branded stupid by dissenters and roundly criticised on social media ainaorg reports. Sheikh Motlab al Nabet spokesman of the Saudi Arabian Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice said they had the right to force women to cover their face. The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes especially the tempting ones he said. We have the right to do so. Many commentators wondered how the word tempting would be applied. One unnamed journalist in the country suggested it referred to uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup. Or even without makeup if they are beautiful the woman will be in trouble they added. Prince Naif whose impending ascension to the Saudi throne many hoped would spell an end to this kind of draconian oppression looks likely to be as intolerant as his father King Abdullah after suggesting that any Muslim should support the Committees new law. The committee is supported by all sides he said. It should be supported because it is a pillar of Islam. If you are a Muslim you should support the committee
1704,The Wall Street Journal is reporting that according to a person with knowledge of the matter Microsoft is in serious discussions to buy Mojang the studio that made smash hit Minecraft. The deal is reported to be worth a whopping 2 billion and could be signed as early as this week. we have contacted both Microsoft and Mojang for comment and will update if we hear back. it is worth remembering that in June this year Mojang founder Markus Persson wrote in a blog post Mojang does not exist to make as much money as possible for the owners.

875,A source familiar with the matter has told Benzinga that Chinas Lenovo Group Limited could make an offer to acquire Canadian mobile communications company BlackBerry Ltd as early as this week. The source said Lenovos first offer would be 1500 per share with a deal ultimately getting done around 1800 per share. Lenovos CFO Wong Wai Ming said in January 2013 that BlackBerry was one of many possible opportunities for the company. BlackBerry played down the comment.

1475,ISIS terrorists released a video Tuesday that claims to show the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff. In the video titled A second message to America Sotloff 31 of Florida can be seen kneeling in orange garb in front of a black cloaked executioner following news footage of President Obama taking tough about the terror group. Sotloff says into the camera that he is paying the price for US intervention in Syria. I am Stephen Joel Sotloff I am sure you know exactly who I am by now and why I am appearing before you. And now it is time for my message he says. Obama your foreign policy of intervention in Iraq was supposed to be for the preservation of American lives and interests. So why is it that I am having to pay the price of your interference with my life. Am I not an American citizen. You have spent billions of US taxpayers dollars and we have lost thousands of our troops in our previous fighting against the Islamic State. So where is the American interest in reigniting this war. From what little I know about foreign policy I remember a time where you could not win an election without promising to bring our troops back home from Iraq and Afghanistan and to close down Guantanamo Sotloff says. Here you are now Obama nearing the end of your term and having achieved none of the above and deceivingly marching us the American people into a blazing fire. The masked ISIS killer adds in a British accent I am back Obama and I am back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State. Just as your missiles continue to strike our people our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people. it is unclear if the executioner is the same fiend who beheaded James Wright Foley on video two weeks ago. As Sotloff then tries to stand his killer starts to slit his throat. The camera cuts out then footage shows what appears to be Sotloffs severed head placed on his body. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was in the middle of a daily briefing with reporters in DC when news surfaced about the new video which lasted roughly 3 minutes. Earnest said authorities were working to confirm its authenticity while adding Our thoughts and prayers are with Mr Sotloff and Mr Sotloffs family. A man answering the phone at a Sotloff family home in Miami told The Post on Tuesday I can not talk right now. I am sorry before hanging up. Sotloff — who freelanced for Time magazine as well as Foriegn Policy and the Christian Science Monitor — was abducted in Syria in August 2013. He was last seen in the grisly video of Foleys execution — when the terrorist killers threatened that he would be next. The life of this American citizen Obama depends on your next decision Foleys ISIS killer hissed at the time. Sotloffs stricken mother Shirley pleaded from mercy from his captors in a heartbreaking video released last week. My son Steven is in your hands Shirley Sotloff said. Steven is a journalist who traveled to the Middle East to cover the suffering of Muslims at the hands of tyrants. Steven is a loyal and generous son brother and grandson she said. He is an honorable man and has always tried to help the weak
2567,Donald Trump has said he was thinking of this Russia thing when he decided James Comeys fate – contradicting the White House rationale that he fired the FBI director for mishandling the Clinton email investigation. Comey had been leading an investigation into possible collusion between Trump advisers and Russian officials when he was dismissed by the president. Defending that decision in an interview on NBC News on Thursday Trump said And in fact when I decided to just do it I said to myself I said You know this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story it is an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won. Trump also said there were three occasions on which Comey assured him he was not under investigation. The president said he called the director of the FBI to ask for an update on a possible criminal investigation into his ties with Russia. Acting FBI head disputes White House claim Comey had lost staff support Read more In the NBC interview Trump also flatly contradicted his own vice president and spokesman by saying he decided to fire James Comey before receiving a recommendation from the deputy attorney general. Trump recalled three conversations with Comey about the FBI investigation into Russian interference in last years presidential election. First he said there was a dinner which was also about Comeys future raising the prospect that Trump could threaten his job. He wanted to stay on at the FBI Trump said and I said I will you know consider and see what happens … But we had a very nice dinner and at that time he told me You are not under investigation. Acting FBI director refutes claims that staff lost faith in Comey Then there were two phone calls one made by Trump another by Comey. The president admitted I actually asked him yes. I said If it is possible would you let me know am I under investigation. He said You are not under investigation. The revelations are likely to trigger a fresh storm of criticism. Perceptions that Trump fired Comey because of the Russian investigation have been central to the controversy surrounding the dismissal. Meanwhile Trump asking whether he was under investigation would not be illegal but highly irregular. On Thursday Trumps words earned immediate comparisons with then attorney general Loretta Lynchs controversial meeting with Bill Clinton last June during the investigation into Hillary Clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state. Matthew Miller a former spokesman for the Department of Justice told MSNBC it is completely inappropriate for Trump to ask that question … It would also be a violation of DoJ rules for James Comey to answer it. Asked at Thursdays White House press briefing if it was inappropriate for Trump to have asked Comey if he was under investigation deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said No I do not believe it is. She added I do not see it as a conflict of interest and neither do many of the legal scholars who have been commenting on it over the last hour. Sanders did not identify which legal scholars that she was referring to. When the president fired Comey on Tuesday the White House released a memo from deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein that criticised Comey for mishandling last years investigation into Hillary Clintons emails. Press secretary Sean Spicer claimed it was this memo that prompted Trump to remove Comey a position backed by vice president Mike Pence on Wednesday. Pence said in an interview with CNN that Trump had made a decision to accept the recommendation of the deputy attorney general and the attorney general to remove Director Comey. But in the NBC interview Trump said of Comey he is a showboat he is a grandstander the FBI has been in turmoil. You know that I know that. Everybody knows that. You take a look at the FBI a year ago it was in virtual turmoil less than a year ago. It has not recovered from that. He explained I was going to fire Comey. My decision. I was going to fire Comey. there is no good time to do it by the way. I was going to fire regardless of recommendation. The revelation came amid a flurry of reports suggesting that Trump had grown increasingly irate with Comey in recent weeks because of his high profile his failure to stop leaks his pursuit of the Russia investigation and his lack of support for the presidents claim that he was wiretapped by Barack Obama. In the end he fired Comey late on Tuesday afternoon a move that seemed to take many White House staff by surprise. The official reason given was the FBI directors mishandling of the investigation into Clintons emails. The acting head of the FBI meanwhile said on Thursday that Comey enjoyed broad support among its staff – directly contradicting the White House assertion that he had lost the confidence of the FBI rank and file. Confronted at a Senate intelligence committee hearing with the claim of Comeys unpopularity Andrew McCabe said That is not accurate. I can tell you I worked very very closely with Comey from the time we started at the Washington field office he said. I hold Director Comey in the highest regard for his considerable abilities and his integrity. It is the greatest honour of my professional life to have worked with him. He enjoyed broad support in the FBI and he still does to this day … the vast majority of FBI staff enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey. In contrast Sanders told reporters on Thursday that she had been in contact with countless FBI agents via text and email who expressed their support for the decision. She did not identify them or explain why a White House press staffer would be in contact with FBI agents. Earlier on Thursday Sanders told CBS News Trump was very likely to visit FBI headquarters in the next few days. But later the MSNBC network reported that the visit would not be happening after agency officials told the White House that Trump would not be greeted warmly. Making his first public appearance since Comeys dismissal McCabe promised to tell the Senate committee if he came under pressure to shut down the investigation into possible links between Trumps associates and Russia during last years election. He said he had met Trump this week but the Russian investigation did not come up. Asked by Senator Marco Rubio if Comeys abrupt dismissal would impede the work of the FBI McCabe was adamant. You can not stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing and upholding the constitution he said. Later he said the Russian investigation would be pursued vigorously and completely. To reports of Comey having asked for more resources for the investigation McCabe said he was not aware of any such request and insisted the Russian investigation had the resources it needed. Opening the hearing on global threats that heard evidence from the heads of the main US intelligence agencies the committees Republican chairman Richard Burr said it would not be solely focused on the Trump Russia enquiry. However Democratic senators repeatedly returned to the issue. It is impossible to ignore that one of the leaders of the intelligence community is not here with us today said the top Democrat on the committee Mark Warner. The presidents firing of FBI director Comey … was a shocking development. The timing of Director Comeys dismissal to me and many committee members on both sides of the aisle is especially troubling. He was leading an active counterintelligence investigation into any links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government or its representatives and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russias efforts to interfere in our election. For many people including myself it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the presidents decision to remove Director Comey was related to this investigation. And that is unacceptable. It emerged on Wednesday evening that the committee had issued a subpoena for the presidents former national security adviser Michael Flynn requesting documents relevant to the committees investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election. Comey – who found out he had been fired when the news flashed up on a screen behind him when he was addressing staff in Los Angeles – sent a farewell letter to FBI staff on Wednesday. It is very hard to leave a group of people who are committed only to doing the right thing he wrote. My hope is that you will continue to live our values and the mission of protecting the American people and upholding the constitution
261,Well this is about as shame inducing as it gets. A new viral video produced by Everlast shows young men in Lima Peru getting a big surprise during a catcall session. In a segment titled Harassing Your Mother Everlast took a group of women and changed up their looks with makeup and wardrobe changes and then had them walk past their own sons. After the young men embarrassed themselves with offensive exclamations like tasty panties and Hello piggy the women revealed themselves. NEWS This woman turns catcalls she receives into embroideries As you can imagine the resulting confrontations showed the sons backpedaling on their catcalls and the mothers giving a piece of their mind. Everlast put together this spectacle to highlight the rampant sexual harassment in Peru—nearly seven in 10 women have been catcalled. Even if it is not the most realistic situation it still does a great job of showing how uncomfortable a simple commute can be for Peruvian women. Heres hoping these brats learned a lesson
2222,Of all the Apple rumors coming out of the Far East recently the one with the most legitimacy seems to be Apple producing an iPhone with a 4 inch display next year. Although the reports are unsubstantiated returning to the small smartphone market would be a good move for Apple. According to the Electronic Times of Taiwan the supply chain for Apple production in 2015 includes the components for a smaller handset than the iPhone 6. The report states that Apple is producing the smaller model for the convenience of single handed operation of female users. Even though Apple has turned to the larger smartphone and phablet market with the release of the iPhone 5 and 6 respectively there are still users who prefer the smaller screens and the ability to use a smartphone with just one hand. As phones get bigger it becomes impossible to do even the simplest tasks without both hands. The new phone is rumored to be replacing the iPhone 5c model. The 5c has been Apples budget model since its release in September 2013. The 5c lacked many of the features of the 5s model such as using the Apple 5 models A6 chip instead of the A7 that came with the 5s not having Touch ID lacking the M7 motion co processor and other minor features. The iPhone 5c was discontinued in September 2014 when the iPhone 6 was announced. According to Pocketnow this rumor might signify that Apple wants to standardize their current iPhone models with a small mid sized and phablet display. Whether the new 4 inch iPhone would be marketed as a budget iPhone is impossible to say at this point. Apple stayed with a 35 inch display for five generations as its rivals grew progressively larger. Steve Jobs founder of Apple said in 2010 that the smaller screen was better because it was easier to get your hands around it. This article originally appeared at Digital Journal. Copyright 2014.

58,When Tim Cook hits the stage Monday to reveal availability and pricing information about Apple Watch the biggest question he will answer will be about the price of the high end Edition line. Rumors have pegged that price to range between 5000 and 20000. Not a lot perhaps compared to a gold Rolex. But a 20 year old Rolex will still tell the time. Who knows how functional the first Apple AAPL 097 Watch will be in five years. There is now a new development in the pricing story. A new Apple patent has surfaced for a Method and Apparatus for forming a gold metal matrix composite. In simple terms this new Apple gold is lighter stronger and more scratch resistant than ordinary 18 karat gold through alloys of low density ceramic particles instead of precious metals. It also contains roughly half the amount of pure 24 karat gold as ordinary 18 karat gold. The math is all explained in geeky detail on a blog called All This. How much actual gold will be in the Apple Watch Edition. For the models on Apples current Edition page the answer is about half an ounce. What Apple is not showing on this page is a gold Edition with a solid gold link bracelet. This bracelet only appears in stainless steel on the Apple Watch Collection page. It is not an unreasonable assumption that Apple will roll out a gold link bracelet Edition which could add another full ounce of gold. Apple Watch Edition value of gold Still with John Gruber of Daring Fireball estimating a price range of 10000– 20000 for the Edition the profit margins start looking a little rich. Marco Arment is calling it at 5000 but he is not talking about a solid gold bracelet. In the fine jewelry business it is not uncommon for the retail price to be between five and ten times the cost of the raw materials. Apple reported in September that the profit margin for the entry level iPhone 6 was 69 and slightly higher for the pricier models. That iPhone 6 costs Apple 216 to make according to a teardown published in Recode. let us assume that the basic Apple Watch will cost Apple no more than that considering that it is retail prices is supposed to start at 349. That would have the total cost to Apple for the Apple Watch Edition at less than 1000 and the model with the bracelet just above 2000. The economics of the Apple gold could allow pricing with iPhone level profit margins to be 2999 and 6999 respectively. For those expecting price points of 5000 and 10000 or 10000 and 20000 this reasonable pricing would be a welcome surprise. As surprising as it is that the high end Edition could contain so little actual gold this is not at all a bad thing. Not only will this new process make the Apple Watch Edition lighter for delicate wrists and more resiliant but it also might help the cause of affordable luxury that Apple has championed. More significantly this level of innovation in manufacturing follows through on Apples commitment to using fewer resources in its products. And since the mining of gold involves a lot of dangerous and underregulated human labor it is a win in an area that Apple has taken a lot of heat about for years. From the investor point of view if the gold Apple Watch is a hit like the iPhone 6 Plus has been the money saved on gold will add meaningfully to Apples already healthy bottom line. Update As reader Michal Kvasnica points out the Apple Watch Edition will literally be worth its weight in gold. My original headline was intended rhetorically not literally. Apple can claim its new gold metal matrix composite is 18 karat because it will be 75 solid gold by weight. The overall weight per volume is where Apple has achieved the savings. The low density ceramic particles represent a surprising proportion of the volume of the material but still only contribute 25 to the weight. Since no one will buy an Apple Watch Edition with the intention of melting it down for gold the real point is that Apple gold is great from an engineering perspective but bad in terms of intrinsic value. Passing the savings along to the consumer reinforces Apples affordable luxury brand promise. A 10000 starting price in my opinion would be abusing that promise
1629,A Russian fisherman says a Justin Bieber ringtone on his phone scared away a bear that was mauling him near his favorite fishing spot according to video from Newsy. Igor Vorozhbitsyn says a brown bear jumped on him and began mauling him before his mobile phone went on and began playing the Bieber tune Baby. The victim who had already suffered severe cuts and bruises said the bear ran off in fear once the tune began playing. He was found by other fisherman who used his phone to call for help Newsy says. Scientists explain that it was not necessarily a Bieber tune that scared off the bear off it could have been any unexpected loud noise. However the victim felt a need to explain why he had the Bieber song as a ringtone telling news outlets that his granddaughter uploaded it as a joke

449,This story originally appeared in The Daily Mail Fierce fighting has been reported on the outskirts of Baghdad where ISIS militants are attempting to seize control of the Iraqi capital despite ongoing Western airstrikes against the terror group. The fighting is taking place just one mile to the west of the city with government forces desperately trying to hold off the militants who allegedly killed up to 1000 soldiers during clashes yesterday. ISIS have held a number of towns and villages close to the Iraqi capital since earlier in the year when government troops melted away following a lightning advance in the west of the country enabling the terrorist group to seize further swaths of territory for their so called caliphate. Reports that ISIS militants are now just one mile from Baghdad came from the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East an organisation supporting the work of Canon Andrew White vicar of the citys St Georges Church the only Anglican church in Iraq. In a message posted on Facebook the group said The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad. They said it could never happen and now it almost has. Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to be hear a very short while to know they can do very very little they added. The claims were backed up by Canon White himself who shared the message just hours after he had earlier suggested the group were approximately six miles from the centre of Baghdad. In a message he also posted on Facebook Canon White had said The Islamic State are now within 10km of entering Baghdad. Over a 1000 Iraqi troops were killed by them yesterday things are so bad. As I said all the military air strikes are doing nothing. If ever we needed your prayer it is now. The militants are understood to have had their advance halted by airstrikes yesterday at Ameriyat Al Falluja yesterday a small city about 18 miles south of Fallujah and 40 miles west of Baghdad. But the clashes did not force the bulk of the fighters with many of them now having made their way to the Baghdad suburbs for this mornings fighting. Read the full story at The Daily Mail
2063,An Islamic State video has appeared which purports to show the beheading of Steven Sotloff a US journalist being held hostage by the militants. Mr Sotloff disappeared in Syria in 2013. He appeared at the end of a video last month showing fellow US journalist James Foley being killed. After Mr Foleys death Mr Sotloffs mother appealed to IS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi to save her sons life. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said US officials were checking the reports. The US has recently carried out dozens of air strikes against IS targets in Iraq. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says the apparent beheading is a way for IS to get back at the US for its actions. Mr Earnest urged caution about the veracity of the video. I am not in a position to confirm the authenticity of that video or the reports he said. If there is a video that is been released it is something that will be analysed very carefully by the US government and our intelligence officials to establish its authenticity
525,The hackers behind a devastating cyberattack at Sony Pictures have sent a new message to executives at the company crediting them for a very wise decision to cancel the Christmas day release of The Interview a source close to the company told CNN. The email message was received by Sonys top executives on Thursday night and was obtained by CNN. The source said that the company believes the email was from the hackers because it followed a pattern of previous messages sent to a list of particular executives and formatted in a particular way. A Sony spokesman declined to comment. The hacker message is effectively a victory lap telling the studio Now we want you never let the movie released distributed or leaked in any form of for instance DVD or piracy. The message also says And we want everything related to the movie including its trailers as well as its full version down from any website hosting them immediately. It warns the studio executives that we still have your private and sensitive data and claims that they will ensure the security of your data unless you make additional trouble. The email was titled Message from GOP. The anonymous hackers have called themselves Guardians of Peace. Sony is still reeling from the late November cyberattack that crippled its computer systems and now it is under severe scrutiny for canceling the Christmas release of The Interview Seth Rogen and James Francos comedy about an attempted assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong un. US officials now believe North Korea instigated the hack lending credence to the Sony executives who privately started calling it a terrorist act weeks ago. Since the cancellation on Wednesday the same executives have been wondering whether the leaks of private emails and corporate documents would now stop. Thursday nights message implied that the leaks will stop. In a statement on Wednesday when the films release was scrapped the company said we stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression and are extremely disappointed by this outcome
1220,International Business Machines Corp is reportedly on the cusp of laying off about 26 of its 430000 strong workforce or 111800 people as part of its biggest ever corporate restructuring. The unconfirmed report from Forbes suggests that US employees will be hit hard in the overhaul code named Project Chrome but that the layoffs will stretch to many of the companys worldwide service operations. In his report long time Silicon Valley journalist Robert X Cringely writes that the massive cuts will start this week and be completed by the end of February. The layoffs would be the largest in the companys history topping 60000 jobs it cut in 1993. IBM shares rose 2 or US 313 to US 15900 in early morning trading in New York. Cringelys report suggests that Project Chrome has been in the works since before Christmas and is likely being rolled out now in response to IBMs announcement last week of its 11th straight quarter of falling revenue. Revenue fell 12 in the fourth quarter shrinking across every reported unit and every geography. The technology and consulting company has struggled as business customers have moved away from buying big mainframe computers and traditional software that is installed on their own systems. Related IBM Corp fourth quarter earnings beat analysts expectations Apple IBM partnership launches first wave of enterprise apps with big help from Toronto Advertisement IBM has been spending heavily to develop new products such as data analytics and artificial intelligence programs and cloud software that IBM delivers to customers over the Internet. But those new businesses have not grown as fast as the company hoped while revenue has continued to fall in IBMs traditional software hardware and technology services businesses. Cringely paints the coming cuts as a pure accounting resource action engineered by executives and designed to make IBMs financials look better for the next few quarters.

1907,In order to become a reality star a woman from Florida underwent an expensive surgery to implant a third breast on her chest. Massage therapist Jasmine Tridevil decided to take the extreme step as she wants her own reality show on MTV the 9 News reported. Tridevil reportedly spent 20000 to have a third breast. The procedure was done a few months ago and the extra breast was constructed with silicone implants and skin tissues taken from her abdomen the website reported. However Tridevils doctors could not create an artificial areola which she managed on her own by tattooing it. Nevertheless the reality show aspirant had a difficult time finding a doctor who would do the procedure by ignoring medical ethics. I called 50 doctors. It was really hard finding someone who would do it too because they are breaking the code of ethics she told real radio 1041 via 9News. When asked about her familys reaction to the creepy news of her third breast implant she said My mum ran out of the door. She will not talk to me. She will not let my sister talk to me. My dad he really is not happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it. Tridevil went on to claim she wanted this to happen to make herself look unattractive as she is not interested in dating anymore. I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I do not want to date anymore she said. Most guys would think the extra breast is weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore make up and cute clothes I can still you know feel pretty. Reality shows on popular networks have always fascinated youngsters who want to grab their 15 minutes of fame and become popular. Reality and fantasy are blurred. The consequences of bad behaviour and poor choices are never questioned. On the contrary bad behaviour is welcomed because sensationalism attracts more viewers. The danger lies in that they lose sight of their own sense of self worth and critical thinking a report from NDLA reads.

1587,Apparently Lenovo is still interested in BlackBerry. Chinas Lenovo could make an offer to acquire the Canadian smartphone maker as early as this week a source familiar with the matter told Benzinga. Lenovo expressed interest in buying the Waterloo based tech titan last year but the Canadian government told the Beijing based computer manufacturer it would not allow a Chinese takeover citing national security concerns. This time could be different however because Lenovo announced the creation of a new company focused on the internet of things a space which BlackBerry has shown emerging interest in. That new company slated to launch next year would operate under a separate name and brand. According to Benzinga Lenovo would hope to acquire BlackBerry for approximately 18 a share or just under double the companys current stock price
1765,A five year old has been handed an invoice and his parents threatened with court action for missing his friends birthday party. Derek Nash and his partner Tanya Walsh discovered the £1595 no show fee invoice after it was slipped into their son Alexs school bag. Mr Nash said he originally thought it was a joke but the issue has remained unresolved with the birthday boys mother Julie Lawrence threatening small claims court. His partner confronted Ms Lawrence in a series of posts on Facebook in a bid to resolve the situation. The family confirmed their son would be attending the party at the Ski Slope and Snowboard Centre just before the Christmas holidays. However Mr Nash from Torpoint Cornwall realised he had already arranged for their daughter to go on a day trip with her grandparents. He said She saw me and asked if Alex was coming to the party. At this time I agreed and said that Alex was looking forward to it. By this time we did not have a contact number email or an address to let the boys mother know. So on the day of the party we asked Alex what he wanted to do he chose to be with his grandparents. Alex returned to Torpoint Nursery and Infant School on January 6 but the family were shocked to receive the bill just over a week later. Mr Nash added My partner looked out for the friends mother to apologise for Alex not showing up to the party but did not see her. But on January 15 she looked in Alexs school bag and found a brown envelope. It was an invoice for £1595 for a childs party no show fee. I asked Alexs class teacher if the childs mother had given anything to her. She said Yes a brown envelope. I then visited Alexs school head teacher who could not apologise enough that one of the teachers had passed this on. She said she would remind all staff that this was a breach of protocol. I left the school and went to see the birthday boys mother as her address was on the invoice. When she answered the door I told her I had found the invoice in my sons school bag and that I was not happy about it. I told her I would not be paying her the money. I told her she should have spoken to me first and not put the invoice in my sons school bag. Julie Lawrence and her husband Simon I would have sympathised with her about the cost of Alex not showing up but I just can not believe the way she has gone around it. Ms Lawrence has since threatened the family that she would take the case to a small claims court while the birthday boy will no longer play with Alex at school. Mr Nash added I drive all around the south west for my job and I have talked to quite a few people about this. they are all quite incredulous that this has happened. I thought it was a joke to begin with. I am lost for words. Ms Lawrence said the boys non attendance left her out of pocket and insisted his parents did have details to tell her he was not going. She said in a statement All details were on the party invite. They had every detail needed to contact me
685,New details are surfacing about what happened when Joan Rivers was having surgery and a source has revealed to CNN that her doctor took a selfie inside the operating room while she was under anesthesia. The 81 year old comedian was scheduled to receive just an endoscopy at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic but after the clinics medical doctor Lawrence Cohen finished the procedure an unidentified doctor performed an unplanned biopsy on her vocal cords. Investigators think that Joans vocal cords began to swell during the biopsy which caused oxygen to stop flowing to her lungs. This led to her going into cardiac arrest. Dr Cohen is not currently performing procedures…nor is he currently serving as medical director following Joans death. Despite this the clinic denies that the vocal cord biopsy was performed at the clinic
469,Many people have not even gotten their iPhone 6 devices yet and already the rumors are starting up about what Apple has planned for its next generation handsets. One slightly sketchy rumor citing sources in the Apple supply chain in China suggests 2015s iPhone lineup could include a 4 inch model in line with the size of the iPhone 5 and 5s. According to the report the idea would be to appeal to female users who are put off by the larger screen size of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. The rumor does not elaborate on whether Apple would create a new 4 inch iPhone from scratch or refresh a previously launched model instead. we are not convinced. Personally I had suggest the report is 99 percent likely to be nonsense. Apple only just upgraded to the larger screen size with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus to both critical and commercial acclaim. Between them the two handsets smashed records with 10 million sales in their first weekend on sale and analysts are predicting 715 million more units will sell over the holidays. For all the criticisms we have heard about the new iPhones virtually none have suggested both handsets are too big for a substantial portion of users. Larger phablet phones have also consistently shown themselves to be the fastest growing smartphone category — and particularly popular in Asia which is where Apple is focused on expanding its presence in
635,let us face it Apples not so good at social. Path the former private social network with not many users sucks at social too. Now Apple is reportedly buying Path. It all makes so much sense. The news comes via PandoDaily which quotes an anonymous single well placed source inside Apples engineering team as saying it is almost done if not signed already but it is essentially a done deal. Despite claims of a growing user base in recent months Path with its 25 million users still lags far behind giants like Whatsapp Facebook and Twitter. The company has been hemorrhaging employees and making desperate attempts to bounce back by releasing apps like Talk a private messenger with bells and whistles and a premium version with stickers and photo filters that no one really pays for. Still the app did gain critical acclaim for its beautiful user interface so perhaps Apple could be its natural home. Cult of Mac points out that Paths ties to Apple go way back. Path CEO Dave Morin is a former employee and during Tuesdays iPhone 6 keynote he was spotted sitting up front a place usually reserved for Apple executives. According to PandoDaily the app itself is likely to survive the acquisition by being incorporated into Apples newly refreshed Messages app in iOS 8. How. Your guess is as good as ours.

1609,Iraqi officials said Sunday that the head of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was wounded in an airstrike in western Anbar province. Pentagon officials said they had no immediate information on such an attack or on the militant leader being injured. Iraqs Defence and Interior ministries both issued statements saying al Baghdadi had been wounded without elaborating and the news was broadcast on state run television Sunday night. The reports came at a time when US President Barack Obama said the US led coalition was in a position to start going on the offensive against the ISIS militants. Al Baghdadi believed to be in his early 40s has a 10 million US bounty on his head. Since taking the reins of the group in 2010 he has transformed it from a local branch of al Qaida into an independent transnational military force. He has positioned himself as perhaps the pre eminent figure in the global jihadi community. His forces have seized large parts of Syria and Iraq killed thousands of people beheaded Westerners and drawn the US troops and warplanes back into the region where Washington is leading a campaign of airstrikes by a multinational coalition. An Interior Ministry intelligence official told The Associated Press that al Baghdadi was wounded by an Iraqi airstrike that came during a meeting Saturday with militants in the town of Qaim. The official cited informants within the militant group. A senior Iraqi military official also said he learned in operational meetings that al Baghdadi had been wounded. US also targeted ISIS leaders in weekend strikes The operation was carried out by Iraqi security forces both officials said although they did not know how seriously al Baghdadi was hurt. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss confidential material. A statement posted Sunday on the official Facebook page of Defence Minister Khalid Obeidi also said al Baghdadi was wounded but added that he was targeted in the northern city of Mosul currently the groups biggest stronghold in Iraq. A senior US defence official said Saturday that the coalition conducted a series of airstrikes targeting a gathering of ISIS leaders near Mosul but he could not confirm whether al Baghdadi was part of the gathering. Reports circulated Saturday that al Baghdadi may have been wounded in an airstrike but there was no confirmation at that time from either US or Iraqi officials. The US Central Command said Friday it conducted two airstrikes near Qaim that destroyed a militant armoured vehicle and two checkpoints of the militant group which is also known by the acronyms ISIL and ISIS. On Nov 1 the US military conducted four strikes in the town. When asked about the Iraqi reports Air Force Col Patrick Ryder spokesman for US Central Command in Tampa Florida said Sunday We have no information to corroborate reports that ISIL leader al Baghdadi has been injured. Rami Abdurrahman director of the Britain based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said some ISIS militants wounded in the airstrike near Qaim were taken across the frontier to the Syrian border town of Boukamal. They brought ISIS injured to Aisha Hospital in Boukamal. We do not know if somebody died there or not. We know for sure that they brought some of the ISIS people injured in Roummaneh to the hospital Abdurrahman said. There was no indication that al Baghdadi was among those brought to Boukamal. They brought ISIS injured to Aisha Hospital in Boukamal. We do not know if somebody died there or not. We know for sure that they brought some of the ISIS people injured in Roummaneh to the hospital. Rami Abdurrahman director of Syrian Observatory for Human Rights The reclusive al Baghdadi is known to have made only one public appearance purportedly delivering a sermon at a mosque in Mosul as seen in a video posted online in June. That came five days after his group declared the establishment of an Islamic state or caliphate in the territories it holds in Iraq and Syria. The group proclaimed al Baghdadi its leader and demanded that all Muslims pledge allegiance to him. Since then part of the Islamic State groups core strategy has been to establish administration over lands that it controls to project an image of itself as more than just a fighting force. In parts of Syria under its control the group administers courts repairs roads and even polices traffic. It recently imposed a curriculum in schools in Mosul and in its Syrian stronghold Raqqa scrapping subjects such as philosophy and chemistry and fine tuning the sciences to fit with its ideology. As his forces swept across northern and western Iraq in June and July they seized towns causing several of Iraqs army and police divisions to fall into disarray in the worst crisis in the country since US troops withdrew in 2011. Obama OKs more ground troops in Iraq On Friday Obama authorized the deployment of up to 1500 more American troops to bolster Iraqi forces which could boost the total number of US forces to 3100 and spread advisory teams and trainers across the country including into Anbar province where the fighting has been fierce. The militant Islamist group has overrun a large part of the province in its push to expand its territory which stands at about a third of both Iraq and Syria. Last week hundreds of men women and children with the Sunni Al Bu Nimr tribe were killed by the militant group which apparently feared the tribe would challenge its authority in the province. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters shoot toward Baretle village which is controlled by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria on the edge of Mosul Iraq on Sept 8. Iraqi soldiers joined by militia groups and backed by US airstrikes are fighting to keep the Sunni jihadist group from continuing its violent expansion across the region. 1 of 18 Officials with the Iraqi government as well as officials with the coalition targeting the extremists repeatedly have said that Iraqi tribes are key elements in the fight against the Islamic State group since they are able to penetrate areas inaccessible to airstrikes and ground forces. In an interview with CBS Face the Nation that took place Friday and was broadcast Sunday Obama said its airstrikes which the US first launched on Aug 8 have been effective in scaling back the Islamic State groups advance. Rather than just try to halt ISILs momentum we are now in a position to start going on some offence Obama said. The airstrikes have been very effective in degrading ISILs capabilities and slowing the advance that they were making he added
237,A woman cut off her three year old nephews penis after flying into a rage because he walked in on her using the toilet. Xue Paan 37 now faces jail time following her sadistic punishment of her nephew Qiang Qiang who she was looking after while his mother visited a neighbour in the Henan Province in central China. Xue was reportedly using her phone on the toilet when the toddler walked in and asked if he could play a game on the device. She was so angered by this that she took a blunt kitchen knife and cut his penis off with it then fled the house before her sister Qiangs mother returned. Mother Cai Tuan 27 immediately ran back to the house after hearing her child scream. Qiang Qiang had fainted and was lying in a pool of blood. Next to him was a knife and his penis. It was simply horrific she said. The boys parents rushed him to a hospital where surgeons were able to reattach the appendage before transporting him to a specialist clinic in Beijing. A hospital spokesman said the knife was quite blunt and the cut was not clean so although we reattached the boys penis it was not ideal and he had to have further treatment. Following three surgeries in total hospital workers are now confident the young boys penis will work properly and he should suffer only minor side effects from the attack. His aunt was tracked down and arrested and police say she now faces five years in prison for the horrific attack.

12,A 4 inch version of the iPhone 6 is said to be in development as a replacement for the entry level iPhone 5c. The handset will be launched during 2015 according to Chinese rumour site Fengcom although there it is unknown if the new model would be a scaled down luxury phone or continue to act as the entry level iPhone to Apples range. If true the move would be a return to creating smaller handsets following the runaway success of the 47 inch iPhone 6 and 55 inch iPhone 6 Plus launched in September. iPhones now account of 395 per cent of British smartphone sales the Californian companys highest ever UK market share thanks to strong sales of the new models. The smaller 6 outsold the 6 Plus by 41 across the UK according to Kantar Worldpanel ComTech. The two new handsets swiftly became Apples fastest selling product to date shifting more than 10 million units within three days. A return to manufacturing 4 inch handsets would extend the iPhone 6 design across three differently sized phones. Consumers are unlikely to see the launch of a new iPhone before September 2015 although the companys first smartwatch the Apple Watch is due for release in the spring

According to The Mirror the woman flew into a rage once she discovered her 32 year old husband father of five children had been having an affair. Fan Lung reportedly used his wifes phone to send photos to his mistress 21 year old Zhang Hung in the city of Shangqiu. But his wife Feng 30 found the image and in a rage grabbed the scissors and stormed into the room where he was sleeping and attacked him. He was taken to hospital and emergency surgery was performed but the wife returned to the hospital and cut it off for a second time reportedly throwing it out of the window where it was lost. According to The Mirror a hospital spokesman said The first we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital. Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman. He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again. Doctors and police officers combed the area outside but failed to find the mans missing member. They believed it may have been taken by a stray dog or cat. The hospital spokesman added The man had lost a lot of blood and was taken in for emergency surgery. He is now in a stable condition but is extremely emotionally distraught. The mans lover visited him in hospital and said she planned to marry him as soon as she could. She said It does not matter that he is lost his fertility he has five children already.

411,The nation awoke this morning to headlines of children imitating dogs in fights at a local school and unfortunately the story seems to be trueWhile the Addie can not name the school or those involved as they are all minors the paper can confirm that according to Wendy Wilson of the NSPCA the organisation was called in in June to handle this situationWhen they arrived at the school to investigate Wendy says she witnessed the children fighting so there can be no doubt that the fights were taking placeWhile the NSPCA is unsure how long the fighting had been taking place before they were alerted to this cruel game Wendy has confirmed that the NSPCA was contacted by the Springs SPCA last June to make her aware of children at a Springs school imitating dog fightsHowever when contacted for comment Celeste Kleyn manager from the Springs Springs SPCA says they are not aware of the incidents. Our investigations revealed that the children were engaging in both real dog fighting activities outside of school hours as well as role play whilst at school says Wendy. Animals fighting always results in animals being harmed and suffering no matter the level of sophistication it is taking place at. The issue was brought to our attention by a very observant and proactive principal as there are animal victims involved as well Wendy commented adding The SPCAs mandate is to ensure the welfare of animals as well as their protection. Were there is animal abuse of this nature you will find co current abuses of vulnerable humans. All the children involved in this situation are of primary school age and investigations indicated that all these children were first exposed to the activity of dog fighting by either older children or adults in the community during their primary school yearsAccording to Wendy this is the first time she or her colleagues have come across this type of dog fighting with humans acting as the dogsThe NSPCA brought the situation to the attention of the different SAPS Units and Social Services and workshops were conducted with invitations extended to local SAPS Social Services Child Protection Department of Justice Community leaders School Principals and local SPCAsThese workshops addressed aspects such as recognising animal cruelty and the link that it has with violence towards humans dog fighting and other organised animal crime animal cruelty and children societies role and responsibility with regards to animal protection in South AfricaWendy says that the principle ensured the NSPCA that the fighting role play had been stopped at the school but she says the children could still be engaging in the activity outside of school hoursWhen asked about the adults involved Wendy said that the adults organising the fights are all members of the immediate community and are known dog fighters in the communityShe says the children are forced to watch dogs fighting over weekends and then once at school are forced to re enact the fightsThe children are also encouraged to bet on the outcome of these fights involving children going down on all fours growling and snapping at one another and in some instances injuring one anotherFurther it is believed that the prize for the winning child fighter is a younger child with whom they are encouraged to mate The truth of this is however unclear as Webdy comments I saw the act of canine copulation enacted but I do not know how far this is taken when the children are alone. As I understand it from the children different children are used as the female dogs but most often it tends to be the younger ones who are forced into this role. Captain Johannes Ramphora spokesperson for the Springs police told the Addie that he unaware of this situation and whether or not the police are involved in an investigation into the matter
2359,Claim Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil underwent surgery to add a third breast. UNDETERMINED Example Collected via e mail September 2014 A WOMAN has spent 20000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity. Well this has What does Snopes say. written all over it. Origins On 22 September 2014 a strange story of body modification appeared on the social web. According to several circulating articles a Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil underwent cosmetic surgery to add a third breast to her body. In the initial frenzy of interest in Jasmine Tridevil and her purported third breast lots of linking and re posting of the same information and images occurred. However few looked very deeply at the claims made by the woman shown in the images or her agents or whether such a modification was even feasible. A New York article about the womans third breast reveals a potentially relevant aspect of Tridevils claim. According to the site the Florida woman claims her surgeon forced her to sign a non disclosure agreement and therefore the obvious avenue of corroboration for her claim is closed off The 21 year old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost 20000 and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so could not disclose what doctor performed it. As Jasmine Tridevils claims about a third breast circulate the social web most information being reported appears to come directly from the subject herself without any external confirmation. Tridevils Facebook page and YouTube account appear to be the primary source for verification despite the fact that both host only self taken videos and photos. In one clip posted by Tridevil her breasts appear to be of an entirely different skin tone than her facial skin and limbs Another red flag in Tridevils tale is her stated motivations. Surgeons are ethically bound to decline performing cosmetic surgery on patients without certain mental health clearances and in an interview Tridevil made the rather bizarre claim she set out to make herself look less attractive to men by opting to get a third breast implant I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I do not want to date anymore. Most guys would think the extra breast is weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes I can still you know feel pretty. Jasmine Tridevils third breast tale has a few other potential inconsistencies. Despite claiming to have undergone an incredibly rare procedure she does not go into detail about the operation or state whether she had her other breasts enhanced to match the third one. No third party images of Tridevil have emerged and while she claims to have booked appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live and Inside Edition no evidence has emerged to suggest that any media sources have vetted the story. We have submitted a request for an interview with Jasmine to verify her claim and have not yet received a response. kmnsize 300x250 kmnplacement 1c8834441f20e22a0aef009c095a6cab googleadclient pub 6608306193529351 googleadwidth 468 googleadheight 60 googleadformat 468x60as googleadtype text googleadchannel 0054321535 googlecolorborder 000000
166,This is the stuff nightmares are made of but one teen took it all in her stride. Waking up in the middle of brain surgery sounds like a painful experience but when this happened to 19 year old Iga Jasica she did not feel a thing. The teen just asked the surgeons how the operation was going when she suddenly woke up on the table according to Fox News on Jan 3. It is a mystery as to why the girl woke up during the delicate procedure while on the operating table in Poland. The doctors were shocked to hear her talk to them while they had her brain exposed mid surgery. The hospital is looking into the possibility that the anesthesia was improperly administered. Experts say that the procedure itself could have caused the teen to regain consciousness even with enough anesthesia on board to knock her out. Jasica chatted with the doctors a bit when she woke up during the surgery and apparently she had a lot to say. She brought up the subject of cats to the physicians who were literally working on her exposed brain according to Sports Act today. Even though the teen woke up enough to carry on a conversation she was never in any pain or danger when this happened say doctors. Jasica was having a cancerous growth removed from her brain during this procedure reports Headlines Global News today. The doctors were about half way through the operation when the teen woke up. The teen reports that she was happy to have gone through the operation because she is feeling good today. She also reports that she does not remember waking up and chatting with the surgeons while on the operating table

262,A tweet from an account purporting to be that of former Cosby Show star Lisa Bonet set everybody going Sunday as it sure seemed to be throwing shade at her embattled former costar The tweet was retweeted over 1000 times was picked up by Page Six Fox News and other media outlets and started Twitterers speculating over whether Bonet was fired from the show 24 years ago for more sinister reasons than originally thought. Et cetera. If you have been on the internet you know what happened next. I can assure you that is not her Twitter account and I have had the account suspended Bonets manager Jillian Neal told The Wrap. Bonet is not even on Twitter though naturally some are speculating that Cosby had her account shut down. Image via screengrab —— Follow Evan McMurry on Twitter
165,A FIVE YEAR OLD boy has been billed with a no show fee for missing his friends BIRTHDAY party. Derek Nash and his partner discovered the invoice for the sum of £1595 after it was slipped into their son Alexs school bag. The host of the party gave it to Alex via a teacher after he failed to show up for the get together at a ski slope and snowboard centre in Plymouth Cornwall. Alexs family confirmed that their son would be attending the party just before the Christmas holidays. But Mr Nash from Torpoint Cornwall realised he had arranged for their daughter to go on a day trip with her grandparents. He then asked Alex if he wished to join his sister or go to the party to which he chose to spend time with his grandparents. Bemused Mr Nash said he originally thought the invoice was a joke but the issue has remained unresolved and now the birthday boys mother has threatened to take him to a small claims court. He said She saw me and asked if Alex was coming to the party. At this time I agreed and said that Alex was looking forward to it. However after Alex had changed his mind about the party Ms Nash realised he had no way of contacting the birthday boys mother. So on the day of the party we asked Alex what he wanted to do he chose to be with his grandparents he said. By this time we did not have a contact number email or an address to let the boys mother know. Alex returned to Torpoint Nursery and Infant School on January 6 but just over a week later the family were stunned to receive the bill. Mr Nash continued My partner looked out for the friends mother to apologise for Alex not showing up to the party but did not see her. But on January 15 she looked in Alexs school bag and found a brown envelope. It was an invoice for 1595 for a childs party no show fee. I asked Alexs class teacher if the childs mother had given anything to her. She said Yes a brown envelope. I then visited Alexs school headteacher who could not apologise enough that one of the teachers had passed this on. She said she would remind all staff that this was a breach of protocol. He then went to visit the mother since named as Julie Lawrence and whose address was on the invoice and told her that he would not be paying the bill. I told her she should have spoken to me first and not put the invoice in my sons school bag he said. I would have sympathised with her about the cost of Alex not showing up but I just can not believe the way she has gone around it. The mother has since threatened the family to take the case to a small claims court while the birthday boy will no longer play with Alex at school. Mr Nash added I drive all around the South West for my job and I have talked to quite a few people about this. they are all quite incredulous that this has happened. I thought it was a joke to begin with. I am lost for words. His partner who does not want to be named has been in contact with the mum on Facebook and is hoping to resolve the situation. In a short statement Ms Lawrence said she had no regrets about sending the invoice. She said All details were on the party invite. They had every detail needed to contact me. Manager of the Plymouth ski and snowboard centre Louisa Duggan said they would never send invoices to individuals and were upset at being dragged into the row. She said This is nothing to do with us. It is a dispute between two parents. But I really need to clarify that we do not send invoices to private individuals ever. We do not know the names of the children coming so we would never even be able to. We are upset that we have been dragged into this. We ask families who book with us to pay a small deposit and then 48 hours before we ask them to confirm the numbers. This gives them plenty of time to get responses in. We are quite flexible if any of the party does not turn up. We can put on other activities to compensate or often an adult will take part in place. We do need to know how many people are coming because we have to plan food and reserve activities and spaces. That is how any businesses like ours has to operate
141,Hewlett Packard plans to split into two companies on Monday according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. One company will be focused on enterprise computing and services and the other will build and sell PCs and printers. Current HP CEO Meg Whitman will lead the enterprise focused version of HP and will be chairman of the PCprinter company which will be led by Dion Weisler as CEO. Details are still fuzzy as to how this will all work but WSJ reported that HP plans to announce the move on Monday. HP is perhaps the seminal Silicon Valley company with a rich history of computing breakthroughs and technology leadership since it was founded in 1939. But despite taking in 112 billion in revenue in 2013 it has struggled over the last decade with the decline of the PC market the rise of mobile computing and the shift to enterprise cloud computing. A series of at times comical leadership fiascos has not helped. I will update this post as more information becomes available and we will certainly cover any announcement HP might make tomorrow
659,North Koreans may face constant starvation and fear of arbitrary arrest but their leader Kim Jong Un has problems of his own. While an exchange student in Switzerland the dictator reportedly became addicted to cheese which has been progressively ruined his health. The dear leaders health problems have reached the point where he now walks with a limp. Switzerlands service to the world. The cheese is called Emmental commonly known as Swiss cheese and Kim Jong Un is so addicted to the cheese that he has it imported despite multiple sanctions. The extent of Kims obesity and consequent health problems became apparent at a recent ceremony in Pyongyang. Kim Jong Un was appearing to remember the passing of his grandfather Kim Il Sung the founder of the modern North Korean state. Kims face was swollen and the dear leader walked with a limp according to a TV appearance. His appearance may have honored Kim Il Song in more ways than one. The founder of North Korea was also overweight and some have suggested the Kim Jong Un stuffs himself to keep up the family image. As defector Cho Myung Chu explained North Koreans think being fat is good unlike South Koreans who want to be skinny. There is a high chance Jong un intentionally gained weight to look like Il sung. Kim Jong Un has even tried to enroll North Korean cooks in European cheese making classes and sent envoys to France. The Europeans politely declined rather than having their cheese making technology stolen. Foreign policy or luxury shopping list. Cheese is not the only luxury the dear leader has a taste for. As previously reported by the Inquisitr North Korea came out in support of Scottish Independence. The reason. So they could get a hold of real Scotch. Of course it is still a long shot if an independent Scotland would ever conduct trade with the rogue state but in the end Kim Jong Un has other ways. Office 39 the North Korean agency responsible for foreign currency reserves has control of an unknown number of foreign trade companies that manage to allude authorities and skirt international sanctions. That might all change soon as the agency has been struggling with management since the execution of Kim Jong Uns uncle Jang Song thaek who was believed to the be the head of the financial institution. Lifting the sanctions may do more to eliminate the dear leader than Seth Rogen and James Franco ever could. If Kim Jong Un continues to consume Swiss cheese as at a rapid pace the dictator may be in capable of ruling much longer. Image Credit Wikimediawallpaperseriescom
453,A teenager woke up in the middle of a brain operation and asked doctors how it was going before chatting about cats. Iga Jasica 19 had been taken to the Central Clinical Hospital in the city of Katowice in southwest Poland for the operation to remove a cancerous growth. But halfway through the critical surgery she woke up after the anaesthetic wore off and started talking to the surgeons about how it was going. Doctors say her brain was exposed at the time. Neurosurgeon Professor Dawid Larysz said Despite coming round she did not feel anything and was never in danger. He said the young woman would not have been able to see or feel anything. Experts said the operation may have triggered something that caused her to come round despite the anaesthetic but doctors are also investigating whether the anaesthetic was properly applied. After the operation Iga said I can not remember much but the doctor said he talked to me about cats which I love. I missed Christmas because of this operation but it is the best present I could have had as I am now feeling great. Daily Mirror
1636,If the bizarre story about Joan Rivers doctor pausing to take a selfie in the operating room minutes before the 81 year old comedienne went into cardiac arrest on August 29 sounded outlandish that is because it was. So says Dr Gwen Korovin Rivers personal physician who on Thursday night shot down a CNN report claiming Korovin was so star struck she took the opportunity of her celebrity patient being unconscious to snap a souvenir photo of the two of them together. CNN citing sources close to the investigation being carried out by the medical examiners office is standing by its claim that a sedated Rivers was clearly visible in Korovins procedure room selfie an allegation Korovins lawyers are calling lies. Korovin also categorically denied performing an unauthorised biopsy on Rivers which according to multiple published reports caused the heart attack that killed the beloved New Yorker during what should have been a routine medical procedure. Whatever Rivers would have made of the escalating drama surrounding her mysterious death those close to her say she would be thrilled by the news that Vanity Fair scribe Leslie Bennetts has been signed to write her biography due out early next year. Joan Rivers life story was in every way a remarkably dramatic roller coaster ride characterised by triumphant highs and devastating lows one that is both wildly entertaining and deeply moving Bennetts said in a statement. it is hard to imagine a more compelling subject for a book or one that would be more fun. And lucrative. Within hours of Rivers death sales of her latest book shot up an impressive and record breaking 70750pc on Amazon. Lost in translation Garth Brooks seems to think his Irish fans were not that put out by the Croke Park debacle.

We saw video footage of people in Ireland at a bar the night we were supposed to be there singing Friends in Low Places and they were having the time of their lives. it is like it is their show. As if. Dowd deals with pot shots Pulitzer prize winning journalist Maureen Dowd is on quite a high after learning that she has been cast as the poster girl for a new Consume Responsibly edible pot publicity campaign. The 62 year old New York Times op ed columnist who got stoned last summer while researching a story about Colorados recent decision to legalise the use of recreational marijuana does not even mind that the pro pot brigade are making fun of her nightmare experience with cannabis to warn rookies about the dangers of overdosing. Dowd who decided to test the benefits of pot with a few bites of a weed infused chocolate bar wrote about the results in a column which was published in June graphically recalling how an hour after ingesting the bar things went haywire. I barely made it from the desk to the bed where I lay curled up in a hallucinatory state for the next eight hours. I was panting and paranoid sure that when the room service waiter knocked and I did not answer he had call the police and have me arrested for being unable to handle my candy she wrote. As my paranoia deepened I became convinced that I had died and no one was telling me. A medical consultant would later tell Dowd that marijuana candy bars are supposed to be cut into 16 pieces for novices a point she used to condemn the marijuana industry for promoting the drug without safety precautions for first time users. On Wednesday the advocacy group Marijuana Policy Project responded to Dowds criticism by unveiling a giant billboard featuring a red haired woman obviously worse for wear on a hotel room bed. do not let a candy bar ruin your vacation reads the tagline. With edibles start low and go slow. Dowd who was not in the slightest fazed at her likeness or her story being used in the ad said she has her own plans for artwork from the billboard. I am going to make it my Christmas card. Now she said adding dryly onto gun control

673,Three Afghanistan National Army soldiers who went missing Saturday night from a Regional Cooperation training exercise at Camp Edwards in Sandwich have been found on near the Canadian border according to sources close to the investigation. Details on where the men were found as well as whether they have been detained have not been provided. The three men are senior military officers from Afghanistan and were cleared by the US State Department to participate in the exercise according to Massachusetts National Guard spokesman Lt Col James Sahady. They were identified as Maj Jan Mohammad Arash Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Capt. Noorullah Aminyar. US Central Command who led the investigation notified The Massachusetts National Guard along with state and local law enforcement of the missing soldiers. However the state and local agencies were not involved in an active search Maj Andrew Aranda a spokesperson for US Central Command told Bostoncom. The three men who speak English were last seen Saturday while chaperoned to the Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis. The Department of Defense has not officially released photos to the public of the missing soldiers. State and local officials have also not been provided with official photos and it is unclear whether they will given any to work with Aranda said. Although the soldiers are considered by military standards as Absent Without Official Leave they are legally allowed to be in the US under documentation similar to a tourist visa. We invited them to the country they are allowed to be here Aranda said. Right now tips will be share with all of the appropriate agencies. There are 200 people from six nations participating in the exercise including 15 officers and senior enlisted personnel from Afghanistan said Sahady. The two week annual exercise sponsored this year by US Central Command is designed to strengthen relationships between the US and participating nations. The soldiers arrived at Joint Base Cape Cod on Sept 11. Non US soldiers underwent a thorough security tracking and vetting process—known as Leahy vetting —before being granted approval to participate. Not all 200 people are locked down on base Sahady told Bostoncom. At some points during their stay participants are cleared to leave for dinner or to participate in activities off base without restrictions he said. Federal and military officials said the men are not considered a threat to the public. All we are worried about right now is for their safety Aranda said. This is not the first reported case of Afghan nationals who have gone missing while undergoing a training program in the US. Two Afghan policemen who were taking part in an intensive DEA training program in Quantico Va went missing while on a sightseeing trip last Thursday. They were found in Buffalo NY on Friday
1495,BEIRUT — The ISIS terror group has published a video titled A second message to America showing the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff. The video also threatens the life of British captive David Haines. Sotloff speaks to the camera before he is killed saying he is paying the price for US intervention. The masked ISIS figure in the video speaks to President Barack Obama telling him Just as your missiles continue to strike our people our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people. Last week Sotloffs mother Shirley Sotloff released a video pleading with ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi not to kill her son. Steven is a journalist who traveled to the Middle East to cover the suffering of Muslims at the hands of tyrants. Steven is a loyal and generous son brother and grandson she said. He is an honorable man and has always tried to help the weak. Sotloff appeared last month in an ISIS video showing the decapitation of another American journalist James Foley. The militant in the video warned that Sotloffs fate depended on what President Obama did next in Iraq. Steven Sotloff disappeared while reporting from Syria in August 2013 but his family kept the news secret fearing harm to him if they went public. Out of public view the family and a number of government agencies have been trying to gain Sotloffs release for the past year. Sotloff 31 grew up in South Florida with his mother father and younger sister. He majored in journalism at the University of Central Florida. His personal Facebook page lists musicians like the Dave Matthews Band Phish Miles Davis and movies like Lawrence of Arabia and The Big Lebowski as favorites. On his Twitter page he playfully identifies himself as a stand up philosopher from Miami. In 2004 Sotloff left UCF and moved back to the Miami area. He graduated from another college began taking Arabic classes and subsequently picked up freelance writing work for a number of publications including Time Foreign Policy World Affairs and the Christian Science Monitor. His travels took him to Yemen Saudi Arabia Qatar and Turkey — among other countries — and eventually Syria. Sotloffs killing likley will step up pressure on Obama to devise a strategy to combat ISIS. On Friday Obama said it is too soon to discuss what steps the US would take against the militant group inside Syria. On how to deal with the group in Syria — where it was born and has a safe haven mostly in the city of Raqqa — the president said We do not have a strategy yet. Obama said Friday that he has asked Americas top defense officials to prepare a range of options

1591,The Beats Music brand could be singing its last tune. According to a report published by TechCrunch Apple has begun to wind down the streaming music service that it acquired in May with many of its staffers already moved onto other projects at Apple. ITunes is said to be one of them. Beats Music CEO Ian Rogers already has been put in charge of iTunes Radio with the Beats Music technology likely to be integrated into that service sources say. Beats Music has not been heavily promoted during Apples recent product demonstrations including the launch of its new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus as well as its Apple Watch. In fact the new smartphones do not include Beats Music pre loaded as an app — an unusual move and sign that Apple has other plans for Beats Music technology. U2s free album was offered through Beats Music. While the Apple Watch out next year will include a music app Beats Music was not mentioned during its launch demo. The confusion two separate music services could generate among consumers is said to be one of the reasons Apple is making the move to close Beats Music. Apple also had shut down another streaming service Lala after acquiring it. While Apple is not expected to entirely do away with Beats Music the company is rethinking whether to still operate it as a separate brand sources also confirmed to ReCode. While Beats Music has the Beats headphone brand helping put it in the spotlight the service has struggled to compete against more established online players like Spotify Pandora Rdio and Google Music. It had just 111000 paying subscribers in March and 250000 in May according to Jimmy Iovine. that is compared to 10 million for Spotify. Beats Music was part of the 3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics Apple made in August. Apple and Beats have not commented on the potential shuttering of the service. Apple is having to take a close look at its iTunes business as digital music sales fell 133 in 2013 whereas streaming grew 32 last year in the US

2099,iFans can look forward to the much awaited smartwatch from Apple making its debut this March if analysts predictions prove true. that is not all the 12 inch MacBook Air is also gearing up to launch in the first quarter. According to a research note from Ming Chi Kuo analyst with KGI Securities the Apple Watch will begin shipping by March.

The Apple Watch is also anticipated to sell 28 million units in the first quarter that is the first month alone in the event that there is a March launch. According to Kuo shipments in the range of 4 million to 5 million will be seen by most component suppliers in March. However a few components may also see low production yields which could affect the assembly and shipping. Kuo also forecast that the much rumored 12 inch MacBook Air with Retina display will also ship in the same quarter which is in synergy with other rumors. A report earlier inJanuary suggested that Quanta Computer an Apple supplier was beefing up production of the notebook to meet the Q1 2015 release deadline.

The analyst sees iPhone shipments touch 617 million unit sales in Q1 2015.

910,The ring little Aiden brought to school may not have been the true ring of power but it had enough controversy to get him suspended from a Kermit Texas school. Tolkien lore led a Texas boy to suspension after he brought his one ring to school. Kermit Elementary School officials called it a threat when the 9 year old boy Aiden Steward in a playful act of make believe told a classmate he could make him disappear with a ring forged in fictional Middle Earths Mount Doom. It sounded unbelievable the boys father Jason Steward told the Daily News. He insists his son did not mean anything by it. The Stewards had just watched The Hobbit The Battle of Five Armies days earlier inspiring Aidens imagination and leading him to proclaim that he had in his possession the one ring to rule them all. Kids act out movies that they see. When I watched Superman as a kid I went outside and tried to fly Steward said. Aiden claimed Thursday he could put a ring on his friends head and make him invisible like Bilbo Baggins who stole Gollums precious in JRR. Tolkiens fantasy series The Lord of the Rings. I assure you my son lacks the magical powers necessary to threaten his friends existence the boys father later wrote in an email. If he did I am sure he had bring him right back. Principal Roxanne Greer declined to comment on the fourth graders suspension citing confidentiality policies according to the Odessa American who first reported Aidens troubles Friday. The family moved to the Kermit Independent School District only six months ago but it is been nothing but headaches for Aiden. he is already been suspended three times this school year. Two of the disciplinary actions this year were in school suspensions for referring to a classmate as black and bringing his favorite book to school The Big Book of Knowledge. He loves that book. They were studying the solar system and he took it to school. He thought his teacher would be impressed Steward said. But the teacher learned the popular childrens encyclopedia had a section on pregnancy depicting a pregnant woman in an illustration he explained. nhensley nydailynewscom
2193,His gorging has seen him put on so much weight that the tubby tyrant now walks with a limp. The addicted 31 year old constantly stuffs his face with the holey Swiss scoff after falling in love with Emmental while he was a student in Switzerland. A Korean source said His intake has increased in recent years with the strain of being in power. This has prompted terrified enemies of the regime who have fled North Korea to claim his poor health is down to his expanding waistline. Kim was spotted limping at a ceremony in the North Korean capital Pyongyang to mark the 20th anniversary of the death of the nations founder his granddad KimIl sung. His face looked swollen and he was limping on his right leg wearing a gloomy expression through the parade. And Emmental which is 45 fat is said to be sending plump Kim to an early grave. The despot – who rules a country where millions are starving – ordered three officials to attend a crash course in cheese making because he was furious at the quality of dairy products in the Asian state. But the director of an acclaimed French dairy production college said the request had been politely but firmly declined. The UN Food and Agricultural Organisation estimates around 28 million people in the country face an ongoing struggle with under nutrition and a lack of vital protein and fat in their diets
2569,You do not have to look hard to find genetically modified food on supermarket shelves More than 85 percent of the corn and soy grown in the United States comes from seeds whose DNA has been rejiggered and those two crops play starring roles in countless processed foods from soda to salad dressing to bread. Advocates say genetically modified foods allow farmers to produce more with fewer chemicals—which means a cleaner environment and cheaper groceries for us all. But the question remains What impact do GM foods have on our health. The answer is no one really knows. GM foods have been on the market only since 1994 and research on their long term effects on humans is scarce. To date most of the studies have been done on animals worryingly though some of those studies link GM foods to altered metabolism inflammation kidney and liver malfunction and reduced fertility. In one experiment multiple generations of hamsters were fed a diet of GM soy by the third generation they were losing the ability to produce offspring producing about half as many pups as the non GM soy group. In addition allergy sufferers worry that as genes are transferred between plants allergenic proteins will pop up in unexpected places. Richard Goodman PhD a professor of food science and technology at the University of Nebraska Lincoln and a former scientist for Monsanto says that seed companies run sophisticated tests to prevent that kind of mistake from happening. But inserting new genes into a seeds delicately constructed genome is always a gamble because scientists can not predict all the consequences. There is for example the possibility of creating brand new allergens. Despite the potential health implications more GM foods appear each year. In 2011 the USDA approved the planting of genetically enhanced sugar beets and alfalfa. The FDA is expected to okay a fast growing salmon in the near future. And possibly on the horizon pigs designed to produce omega 3s. Yet because GM foods are not required to be labeled as such it is impossible for consumers to tell them apart from regular foods. Gary Hirshberg chairman and cofounder of Stonyfield the organic yogurt company thinks that is not right. Last October he partnered with Just Label It a national coalition of nearly 450 organizations that is currently petitioning the FDA to give consumers a choice. More than 600000 people have already signed. The status quo is innocent until proven guilty says Ashley Koff a registered dietitian who studies GM foods as it was for trans fats DDT and countless other harmful chemicals. A labeling requirement would motivate seed companies to prove to consumers that their products are safe to protect their sales. Nearly 50 other countries—including China Brazil and most European nations—have mandated that genetically modified organisms be marked and in an MSNBC online poll 96 percent of more than 45000 respondents said that they should be labeled. At press time 18 states had introduced legislation to promote GMO labeling. Hirshberg for one remains impatient. I am 57 he says. I do not want to wait another 30 years to see what the science says. At this point I want to decide for myself

According to the karma of past actions ones destiny unfolds even though everyone wants to be so lucky… Nothing stays in the dark 4ever. the tweet said. Bonet starred as Denise Huxtable on Cosby and many said they believed the tweet was directed at her former on screen father who has of late suffered a devastating blow to his public persona. Public anger prompted numerous partners to sever relationships with the embattled actor and comedian as a result of allegations he raped more than a dozen women during his career that were reignited by comedian Hannibal Buress last month. The account is no longer on Twitter but it featured the Twitter handle LilakoiMoon and used Lisa Bonet in its full name field. It also included a photo of the actress. Bonet changed her name to Lilakoi Moon while still acting under the name Lisa Bonet. Cosby and Bonet were rumored to have had a falling out during the 1980s because Cosby did not approve of her decision to shoot a sexually explicit scene in the 1987 R rated film Angel Heart or to pose topless for a photoshoot with Interview magazine. Bonet left The Cosby Show to shoot the spin off A Different World but returned after giving birth. She parted ways with the show again in 1991 and chose not to be part of a reunion special. The LilakoiMoon account had been on the social networking service for a number of months and before being shut down had garnered thousands of followers. The user sent tweets to verified Twitter accounts belonging to actor Kadeem Hardison and other members of the Different World cast. Representatives of Twitter did not immediately respond to requests from International Business Times to explain why the account was suspended. An account said to be that of Cree Summer the actress who played Winifred Freddie Brooks on A Different World told followers that the LilakoiMoon was fake in a tweet July 10. I have to let everyone know that LilakoiMoon is not a real account Lisa Bonet my sister Lilakoi Moon is NOT on Twitter. Please do not â€ Cree Summer July 10 2014 Bonets reps have reported confirmed that the Twitter account does not belong to the actress and requested it be taken down. I can assure you that is not her Twitter account and I have had the account suspended talent manager Jillian Neal told TheWrap Sunday
2,A bereaved Afghan mother took revenge on the Taliban after watching them kill her son in an ambush. Reza Gul killed 25 Taliban fighters and injured five others in a seven hour gunbattle in Farah province. Gul who was joined by her daughter and daughter in law engaged the Taliban using AK 47s and grenades despitenever before having used a weapon. The embattled mother told Tolo news a 24 hour Afghan news broadcaster she was awakened by shots early Tuesday. After seeing that her son had been killed Gul and the other two women fought back. I could not stop myself and picked up a weapon Gul told Tolo News. I went to the check post and began shooting back. Seema her daughter in law added The fighting was intensified when we reached the battlefield along with light and heavy weapons. We were committed to fight until the last bullet. Gul said that the battlefield was covered in Talib fighters after the deadly exchange ended. While the Taliban have not publicly commented on the incident the Afghan government labeled it a symbol of a public uprising against the Taliban. Taliban and other groups have regained large swathes of the country as US and NATO forces slowly pull out troops after 14 years of war. The Taliban have targeted government and foreign infrastructure as the group attempts to claw back power it lost in 2001. While the Taliban have made key gains in rural regions members continue to employ suicide bomber tactics in well protected towns and cities. Earlier this week 50 people were killed after a suicide bomber detonated a vest during a volleyball competition in Yahyakahil Paktika province. That particular attack prompted President Ashraf Ghani to order a complete overview of the countrys defense forces and to rethink the ban on nighttime raids which were outlawed by his predecessor Hamid Karzai
889,Tampa Florida Jasmine Tridevil had made international headlines by posting pictures and videos claiming she got a third breast implanted into the center of her chest. The Tampa massage therapist even spoke with 10 News reporter Charles Billi and said it was legit. I figured people would be skeptical but it is true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show she said. And indeed from the outset many were very suspicious of the authenticity of Tridevils claims. Snopescom the urban legends website took an in depth look at her story and concluded the facts decisively pointed to a hoax. And now perhaps the final piece of evidence 10 News has received an an incident report from Tampa International Airport where earlier this month Tridevil reported her baggage had been stolen. The luggage was eventually recovered and two people were arrested for stealing several bags off of the airport conveyor belts. When Tridevil went to retrieve her recovered items a property receipt was written that listed the contents contained within Click here to see a scan of the full page Tough to say how this may affect her prospects for a reality TV show but we can all probably put to rest the question of how real Jasmine Tridevils fake third breast really is.

3,CNBC is reporting Tesla has chosen Nevada as the site of its Gigafactory. We look forward to meeting with Gov. Sandoval and other legislators in Carson City at 4 pm tomorrow to announce a major economic development a Tesla rep told Business Insider. The Gigafactory is a critical piece of CEO Elon Musks plan to make a mass market Tesla car and lower the cost of carbon neutral power. Musk has said he intends to double the worlds supply of lithium ion batteries by 2020 and thus drive the price of the power packs downward. he is also said he plans to build multiple Gigafactories in the future. Tesla had already broken ground on a prospective site outside Reno earlier this summer that only bore the name Project Tiger. The Tahoe Reno Industrial Center currently boasts e commerce facilities owned by Apple Amazon Barnes Noble and Zulily. Teslas facility which is expected to employ 6500 workers is estimated to cost up to 5 billion. CNBC says specific terms of the deal with the state are still being worked out and that it could be a week before they are announced. Dow Jones also reported Nevada was chosen

Despite the extensive injuries veterinarians at the Society expect Bart to survive
2562,President Trumps son in law and now top White House advisor Jared Kushner proposed a secret back channel between the Kremlin and the Trump transition team during a December meeting with a leading Russian diplomat. Kushner spoke with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about creating that line of communication to facilitate sensitive discussions aimed at exploring the incoming administrations options with Russia as it was developing its Syria policy according to a person familiar with the discussions who spoke with the Associated Press. The intent was to connect Trumps then chief national security advisor Michael T Flynn with Russian military leaders said the source who was not authorized to publicly discuss private policy deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity. Russia a pivotal player in Syria has backed Syrian President Bashar Assad often at the expense of civilians during a long civil war. The White House did not acknowledge the meeting or Kushners attendance until March. At the time a White House official dismissed it as a brief courtesy meeting. Kushners involvement in the proposed back channel was first reported by the Washington Post which said he proposed using Russian diplomatic facilities for the discussions apparently to make them more difficult to monitor. The newspaper cited anonymous US officials who were briefed on intelligence reports on intercepted Russian communications. The Post wrote that Kislyak was reportedly taken aback by the suggestion of allowing an American to use Russian communications gear at its embassy or consulate — a proposal that would have carried security risks for Moscow as well as the Trump team. According to the person familiar with the Kushner meeting the Trump team eventually felt there was no need for a back channel once Rex Tillerson was confirmed as secretary of State and decided to communicate with Moscow through more official channels. Tillerson was sworn in Feb 1. Flynn served briefly as Trumps national security advisor before being fired in February after officials said he misled Vice President Mike Pence about whether he and the ambassador had discussed US sanctions against Russia in a phone call. Sally Yates the former acting US attorney general told Congress this month that the deception left Flynn vulnerable to being blackmailed by the Russians. Flynn remains under federal investigation in Virginia over his foreign business ties and was interviewed by the FBI in January about his contacts with Kislyak. The disclosure of the back channel put White House advisors on the defensive Saturday as Trump wrapped up his first foreign trip as president and led lawyers for Kushner to say he is willing to talk with federal and congressional investigators about his foreign contacts and his work on the Trump campaign. Meeting with reporters in Sicily two Trump advisors refused to address the contents of Kushners December meeting with the Russian diplomat. But they did not dismiss the idea that the administration would go outside normal US government and diplomatic channels for communications with other countries. Speaking generally national security advisor HR. McMaster said we have back channel communications with a number of countries. He added It allows you to communicate in a discreet manner. In response to repeated questions from reporters Trump economic advisor Gary Cohn said we are not going to comment on Jared. we are just not going to comment. Kushner was a trusted Trump advisor last year overseeing the campaigns digital strategy and remains an influential confidant within the White House as does his wife Ivanka Trump. Federal investigators and several congressional committees are looking into any connections between Russia and the Trump campaign including allegations that there may have been collaboration to help Trump and harm his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. On Saturday the Associated Press confirmed that the Senate Intelligence Committee which is investigating Russias meddling in the 2016 US presidential election has requested information and documents from Trumps campaign
1448,The Foreign Intelligence Service is reporting today that President Putins order to begin deploying tactical nuclear weapons throughout the Crimean Federal District is intenselydirectly related to a missing and believed stolen low yield atomic cannon shell from its storage bunker in Fort Carson Colorado which is a United States Army installation located near the city of Colorado Springs. According to the SVR the atomic weapon missing from Fort Carson has been identified as a W48 nuclear artillery shell that measures 155 mm in diameter and 84582 mm long. This report notes that the W48 was produced in two models Mod 0 and Mod 1 which weighed 535 and 58 kg respectively and have an explosive yield equivalent to 0072 kiloton. Though the US had reported that all of their W48 nuclear shells had been retired by 1992 this report says the SVR has long noted their continued use for training by US Army 4th Infantry Division forces headquarter at Fort Carson and under the command of North American Aerospace Defense Command forces operating from the Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker complex all of whom are located in El Paso County Colorado. The specific US weapons platform designed to fire the W48 this report notes is the Paladin M109A6 155mm Artillery System 3rd photo left which is currently operated by forces belonging to the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 4th Infantry Division. Over the past few days when this W48 nuclear shell disappeared this report continues the forces of the 1st Brigade Combat Team were involved in training exercises with the 1st Battalion of the 66th Armored Regiment at Fort Carson ahead of their planned deployment in the next few weeks to the Fort Irwin National Training Center in California which will span much of November after which they will be prepared to deploy to combat worldwide. US media reports about this missing W48 nuclear shell are nonexistent this report further notes other than their noting that Fort Carson has been put on a total lockdown as US military forces there continue their search for what they call a lost sensitive item a term they use that refers to gear including weapons ammunition and night vision goggles items that cause high level concern when missing. These media reports further report that whatever is missing it must be small enough to fit in a car causing Fort Carson security officers to spend about two hours inspecting all vehicles leaving Fort Carsons gates yesterday and their spokesman stating As part of random searches at the gate we are conducting outbound vehicle searches in order to prevent the unauthorized removal of government property from the installation. Of critical concern to the Kremlin regarding this missing W48 nuclear shell SVR intelligence analysts in this report state is that if fits nearly exactly to the strange and mysterious war game sprung on world leaders this past March by President Barack Obama that he named nukes on the loose and involved a terrorist attack with an atomic dirty bomb that takes place in the financial heart of an unnamed but Western metropolis. Londons Telegraph News Service in their report on this nukes on the loose war game further noted David Cameron joined Barack Obama Angela Merkel and Xi Jinping and other world leaders to play a nukes on the loose war game to see how they would cope with a terrorist nuclear attack. The German chancellor grumbled at being asked to play games and take tests with the Prime Minister US and Chinese presidents around a table with dozens of heads of state at a nuclear summit in The Hague. Her complaints were overruled because Mr Obama was keen on the idea and in on the surprise. Of equal concern to the Kremlin this report continues are that these events are occurring as predicted by former US Assistant Treasury Secretary Dr Paul Craig Roberts who this past June warned that Obama regime was planning for a preemptive nuclear attack. In his warning Dr Roberts stated Washington not only has war plans for launching a preemptive nuclear attack on Russia and also possibly China but Washington has a cadre of people who advocate nuclear war. We have people running around Washington saying things such as what is the good of nuclear weapons if you can not use them. With the suicidal tendencies of the Obama regime becoming more apparent by the day the SVR in this report grimly concludes Russias near record de Dollarization efforts when coupled with the secret deal between the US and Saudi Arabia to destroy Syria point towards a truly tragic global outcome as the American backed Western economy is near collapse…and all who oppose them will surely suffer their wrath…including the 12 million of their own citizens they currently have under surveillance and targeted for destruction.

535,Mittens is a seemingly regular household cat that enjoys being scratched under the chin and chasing string around but there is one thing about a Newfoundland familys pet that sets it apart – Mittens is a hermaphrodite. Colleen Clarke Murphy who lives in Hearts Desire says her daughter brought Mittens home thinking it was a sick stray that had been abandoned by its owner. Colleen Clarke Murphy of Hearts Desire NL says she was shocked when her veterinarian told her the cat who followed her daughter home had both male and female genitalia. She took the cat to a local veterinarian and after an examination in October got the news that makes Mittens unique. The cat has both male and female genitalia. Clarke Murphy said it was the last thing she expected to hear about the newest addition to her family. Her first response to the vets news was Did I just hear you right. Clarke Murphy said she would prefer to have another female cat — she already has a male and female cat — but she will follow the advice of her vet who recommends Mittens be assigned a male gender. they are the ones who know what they are doing. I mean I really do not know. I had like for it to be a female but it really do not matter. it is got both parts said Clarke Murphy. I think it is got both personalities so it really do not matter. The vet told Clarke Murphy the cat would need to be both spayed and neutered and then have reconstructive surgery once a gender is assigned. Vet bill will be about 1500 While the vet bills are estimated to come in around 1500 for all of the cats surgeries Clarke Murphy said it will be worth it to ensure Mittens is in good health. Mittens Mittens She was part of my family when she came home with my daughter she said. Currently Mittens has bowel issues and problems urinating as a result of its dual gender. Clarke Murphy said a friend is conducting an auction of used items on Facebook to help pay for the familys vet bills She was part of my family when she came home with my daughter. Strays a problem for area Denise Sooley Critch an area volunteer who works on her own to help find homes for strays said there is a big problem with stray animals in the region. Denise Sooley Critch mittens hermaphrodite cat strays Denise Sooley Critch says there is a problem with stray cats in the Hearts Desire region but animals like Mittens show the value of the kind of pet a stray can be. She said the cost of spaying and neutering tends to be the factor that drives people to abandon their cat. That paired with the misconception the SPCA would euthanize the animal leads people to leave the pets outside in the wild. They think by dumping the cats it is actually saving the cats life but it is a horrible death out there starving and freezing said Sooley Critch. However Sooley Critch said she is never heard a story anything like Mittens tale adding that the situation has her blown away It just shows what a stray can be — you do not have to go anywhere and buy an animal you can get a stray at your local shelter

802,Seems like the President of Argentina Cristina Fernández Kirchner did not exactly save a Jewish boy from becoming a werewolf. Apparently this is what happens when a tradition and an urban legend get intertwined. The tradition does dictate that the seventh child born to an Argentine family with six consecutive children of the same sex is eligible to become the godchild of the president and the urban myth says this childs fate is unlucky as it is meant to become a werewolf sooner or later. So technically Lair Tawil was safe. According to the real legend of the lobizón it is only the seventh son of the seventh son who could be potentially cursed. The Guardian reported Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda said The local myth of the lobizón is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president. The tradition of the president adopting a seventh child began in 1907 when then president José Figueroa Alcorta was asked by Russian immigrants Enrique Brost and Apolonia Holmann to become their sons godfather. The couple wanted to maintain a custom from Czarist Russia where the Tsar was said to become godfather to seventh sons and Argentinas president accepted. Although Isabel Perón passed the law in 1974 it is still so that not every seventh child is eligible to become a presidential godchild the honor is only given to those in which seven sons are born consecutively with no daughters in between. The president with most godsons was Juan Perón who had 1982 over three terms in office. Kirchner has already become the presidential godmother of almost 700 children since taking office in 2007 and for all we know she might have saved a few from becoming werewolves
2534,President Donald Trump congratulated newly elected French president Emmanuel Macron and in a brief photo op at the US embassy in Brussels remarked on Macrons tremendous victory. It is my great honor to be with the newly elected president of France who ran an incredible campaign and had a tremendous victory Trump said. All over the world they are talking about it and we have a lot to discuss including terrorism and other things. Congratulations great job he added. After an intense handshake Trump also reportedly told Macron he was his preferred candidate in the face off between the now president and his far right opponent Marine Le Pen. This comes as a surprise given Trumps expression of support for Le Pen during the election campaign which concluded with a Macron victory on May 7. In an interview with The Associated Press Trump said he thought Le Pen was the strongest on borders and the strongest on what is been going on in France though he stopped short of endorsing her. Le Pen had a similar campaign to Trumps successful 2016 bid running on a fiercely anti immigration platform packaged in populist rhetoric. But as it is well known Trump is no fan of a loser which may explain his desire correct the record and confess his long time support of Macron
641,The ship left Sierra Leone on July 13 2014 in destination of the Mexican city of Tampico. Six days after leaving the port of Freetown the captain of the ship reported in a radio communication that three of the crew members were beginning to show distressing symptoms that suggested they could be infected with ebola and that the ship was changing course to head towards Cape Verde to get some medical help. This was the last time that the crew was heard of and all 17 men on board are presumed to have died in only a few days later. The ship could now pose an important threat to the American public as the ship is believed to be infested with thousands of starving rats possibly carrying the ebola virus. Many of the witnesses who came across the ship over the last months have indeed reported seeing the rodents feeding off the crews bodies as the ship went by. Experts fear that these animals could now spread the disease to humans and other animals on the continent creating an uncontrolable ebola pandemic in the United States. The ship is believed to be infested with thousands of ebola ridden rats fear local health authorities The Guinean Luck has been reported multiple times in the Atlantic Ocean drifting away slowly along the North Equatorial Current towards the American continent. It has been sighted almost a dozen times since November 2014 by various ships sailing north of the Antilles. It was last reported to have been seen by fishermen only a few nautical miles North of the territorial waters of Bahamas. Despite their efforts the American authorities have not been able to locate the ghost ship but some recent satellite pictures showing the ship have enabled them to narrow the search area to approximately 400 square nautical miles. A total of 324 coast guard ships and 32 helicopters have already been affected to the search operations forming the largest search force ever created by the US coast guard. Ships and officers of the US Coast Guard from the entire East Coast have been mobilized in a desperate attempt to find and sink the ship before it reaches America. Experts and analysts estimate that the ships actual course and speed will bring it to land or be washed ashore in Southern Florida over the next weeks probably near the densely populated Miami area. The authorities remain confident however that the ship will be found and sunk before it reaches the coast
2381,Details are light and reports are unconfirmed as of yet but news is circulating on social media today concerning a large explosion at a pipeline in Saudi Arabia. Interesting timing A military historian and popular Twitter microblogger using the handle ArmedResearch is reporting a huge explosion of an oil pipeline belonging to Saudi Aramco near Sudair. With all eyes on Saudi and crude right now speculation and conspiracy theories immediately emerged on social media concerning the news. Here are two of the most interesting hypotheses I have seen This is a way to get oil prices to go back up without the Saudis appearing to give in and defend price by voluntarily cutting supply. A pipeline explosion will automatically decrease production. The US Elections are over time for prices at the pump to go back up now. This plays on the long tenured theory that gasoline prices tend to be lowest right before elections as the incumbent party leverages their power to please the masses.

1684,A Grade 4 student was reportedly suspended from his Texas school after he threatened to make another boy disappear with his Lord of the Rings replica ring. Jason Steward told the Odessa American that his son had seen The Hobbit The Battle of the Five Armies last weekend and got himself a replica of fabled One Ring. Steward said his son wore it to Kermit Elementary School where he told another boy the rings magic could make him disappear. Steward said the principal told him no threats would be tolerated — even magical ones. The school would not comment on the suspension citing privacy concerns. The boy has been in trouble before his father said — once for referring to another childs skin colour and once for bringing a childrens book to school that had a chapter about pregnancy. But the dad assured the New York Daily News the nine year old Tolkien enthusiast is not dangerous. I assure you my son lacks the magical powers necessary to threaten his friends existence he said
1194,The shipment of Apple Watch the most anticipated wearable device featuring iOS based user interface designed for smaller devices will commence in March. KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo considered to be a credible source for Apple related news and rumours has revealed this to MacRumors. Ming Chi Kuo expects that Apple might reveal few more details related to Apple Watchs battery life and the pre orders prior to its official launch. While most hardware components of Apple Watch will mark high shipments during the same quarter other key components are expected to see low production rate which could result in a constrained supply Kuo believes. A total of 28 million Apple Watch units which come in three distinct collections such as Apple Watch Apple Watch Sports and Apple Watch Edition units are expected in Q1 2015. The iPhone shipment for the first quarter is likely to be more than 61 million units whereas for iPad it is 10 million units. 12in MacBook Air Kuo asserts that the upcoming 12in MacBook Air could make its international debut in the first quarter with high resolution Retina display and a low powered Intel Core M processor. Besides this it is expected to be the first Apple product to take advantage of new reversible USB Type C connector for charging.

801,In Q1 2015 we expect that Apple could very well release at least two new products – the Apple Watch and the 12 inch MacBook Air. We have heard two separate rumors that the former will be launched in March and the latter will see a general Q1 2015 release but if you are still a little skeptical analyst Ming Chi Kuo has basically confirmed it. Kuo has been known for his pretty accurate predictions regarding Apples product lineup and their release timeframes so there could be some truth in his claims. According to Kuo he confirms that Apple will indeed be releasing the Apple Watch in March and the upcoming 12 inch MacBook Air later on in the quarter as well but no specific dates were provided. According to Kuo the Apple Watch could see some supply constraint. This is due to key components of the wearable having low production yields but Kuo notes that this is not an issue for the other components which should see high shipments in this quarter. He also expects that Apple will ship 25 million Apple Watch units in Q1 2015 alone. Kuo also predicts that Apple will reveal more details about the Apple Watch ahead of its release and offer up more detailed information about its battery life and when pre orders will begin which we guess sounds pretty probable. However as is the case with all rumors they are best taken with a grain of salt for now but do check back with us in the coming weeksmonths where hopefully we will have more details for you
1838,Hewlett Packard Co HPQ 200 plans to break in two separating its personal computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations according to people familiar with the matter. The company plans to announce the move as early as Monday the people said. It is expected to be effected as a tax free distribution of shares to the companys stockholders next year one of the people said. The move is one H P and its investors and analysts have long contemplated. It would come amid a wave of breakups and spinoffs at technology companies and in the wider corporate world underpinned by the idea that companies with a narrower focus perform better. The moves in many cases have been well received by shareholders—if not actively sought by them. On Tuesday online auction pioneer eBay Inc EBAY 077 announced a plan to spin off its PayPal payments processing unit. Shareholders rewarded eBays decision pushing the companys shares up about 75 that day. In 2012 under current H P CEO Meg Whitman H P reorganized itself to combine the PC business with its more profitable printer operation. Ms Whitman will be chairman of the PC and printer business and CEO of the separate so called enterprise company one of the people said. Current lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company while Dion Weisler an executive in the PC and printer operation is to be CEO of that business this person said. In fiscal 2013 the printing and personal systems group as it is known inked 559 billion in revenue about half the Palo Alto Calif companys total. Sales for the operation dropped 71 amid fierce competition compared with a 67 decline for the company as a whole. Last year H P lost its place as the largest PC maker by shipments slipping to No. 2 behind Chinas Lenovo Group Ltd according to industry research firm IDC. H P famously founded in a garage in Palo Alto 75 years ago has been undergoing a multiyear restructuring under Ms Whitman as the company tries to stem sales declines. Aside from the PC and printer business the rest of H Ps revenue comes from selling services and hardware such as servers and data storage systems to corporations as well as software and financial services. H Ps shares have risen sharply since last year but are still well below their highs in recent years—and the even loftier levels they reached in the 1990s tech boom. H P shares increased 2 Friday to 3520 giving it a market capitalization of nearly 66 billion. To combat lower sales and provide lift to its shares H P has laid off tens of thousands of employees and cut other costs. Ms Whitman has sought to push H P further into growth pockets such as cloud software but the company has struggled to make headway in such areas. H P has also been contemplating big strategic changes lately. Over much of the past year the company held talks to merge with data storage giant EMC Corp but those negotiations which would have created an industry giant with a market value of roughly 130 billion recently ended.

940,Dominos was still killing it with the Noid in the 90s when McDonalds rolled out McPizzas to get in on the dinnertime business. The fast food chain made clever signs by tipping Golden Arches sideways into serviceable Zs and Pizza Huts copywriters predicted Every place you see a McDonalds pizza you are going to see a war. Formidable as all that seemed that war never came and McPizza became a nostalgic slice for countless millennials which is why it is insane that two locations owned by a guy along the Ohio–West Virginia border are still cranking out the pizza you will not believa. Two decades ago the chains patented ovens needed five and a half minutes to bake pizzas — time consuming McPizzas were the the McWraps of their day — so most were gone by 2000. it is not clear where Greg Millss locations in the very small towns of Pomeroy Ohio and Spencer West Virginia are getting their raw materials for the discontinued menu items but mysteriously they are still selling. Judy Norman an employee who is been at the West Virginia spot for 11 years tells Canadacom it is the same pizza as they sold when she started there 11 years ago and it is presumably the same that children everywhere enjoyed throughout the 1990s. In other words there may be a way to tap into all that nostalgia but that does not mean it is not freezer burnt. Canadacom

According to Conner she and Lee pulled up at a gas station and were blocked off on all sides by approaching police officers before one of them fired their weapon injuring Conner in her face. However according to police officers Conners boyfriend DeAngelas aggressively drove the car straight at them which is why they decided to fire the bean bag into the car to stop their approach. Broken glass from the shattered car window flew into Conners eye and despite being rushed to a hospital shortly after doctors were unable to save her left eye.

2402,Claim A ghost ship filled with Ebola ridden rats is heading towards Florida. FALSE Example Collected via e mail January 2015 Would like to confirm latest fantastical story making the rounds on Facebook Ghost ship filled with Ebola ridden rats heading for Florida. Origins On 7 January 2015 the entertainment web site World News Daily Report published an article claiming a ghost ship filled with Ebola infected rats was heading towards Florida A large cargo ship originating from West Africa has the American authorities on high alert as it is approaching the coast of Florida. All 17 crew members of the Guinean Luck are reported to have died from the ebola hemorrhagic fever and the presence of thousands of rats possibly infected with the disease aboard the ship could represent a major threat for the American population. The ship left Sierra Leone on July 13 2014 in destination of the Mexican city of Tampico. Six days after leaving the port of Freetown the captain of the ship reported in a radio communication that three of the crew members were beginning to show distressing symptoms that suggested they could be infected with ebola and that the ship was changing course to head towards Cape Verde to get some medical help. This was the last time that the crew was heard of and all 17 men on board are presumed to have died in only a few days later. We are determined to protect the American population from this unique threat says coast guard commander James Fitzgerald. There is no way we are going to let those disease ridden rats set foot in the USA. we are gon na find that ship and we are gon na sink it.

2066,A French police officer who was in charge of investigating last weeks attack on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo that left 12 people dead took his own life after the massacre French television channel France 3 reported. Helric Fredou reportedly shot himself on Wednesday in his police office in the west central city of Limoges with his service weapon. The 45 year old commissioner was found dead by one of his colleagues shortly after he had met with the family of a victim of the Charlie Hebdo attack. He reportedly killed himself while preparing the report. According to France 3 the senior police officer suffered from depression and burn out. In 2013 Fredou discovered the body of one of his colleagues who had also committed suicide. Last week France was in shock following the killing of 12 people in an attack on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo avowedly in retaliation for the magazines defiant stance in publishing cartoons they deemed offensive to Islam.

1399,A scorpion stung a woman on an Alaska Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Portland Ore Saturday night according to media reports from the West Coast. The incident happened after the plane pulled back from the gate and was taxiing out airline officials told ESPN. The aircraft returned to the gate so the woman could be treated. The flight also happened to be carrying the Oregon State University mens basketball team which was on its way back to Oregon after games in Los Angeles. Wayne Tinkle Oregon States head coach tells ESPN the scorpion situation occurred just two rows in front of him. The plane was coming from Mexico before us and the scorpion was on the plane Tinkle tells ESPNs Andy Katz. The woman was a real champ. She acted like it was a mosquito bite. They got it off her but the needle was stuck. Tinkles account mirrored other eyewitness descriptions. No one seemed frantic at all not even the woman who was stung passenger Mike Parker a sports announcer for Oregon State says to CNN. The flight attendants did a great job as did the captain said As for the woman she was treated by medical personnel for a sting on the arm Alaska Airlines spokesman said Cole Cosgrove tells CNN. The woman declined additional treatment. The Oregonian newspaper also confirms Tinkles account of how the scorpion made it onto the aircraft writing Passengers were told the scorpion hitched a ride in the carry on bag of a passenger who had been to Mexico. The flight was delayed by about 30 minutes to respond to the sting. Alaska Airlines officials tell ESPN that an attendant killed the scorpion and that the carrier would have an exterminator thoroughly check the plane upon arriving to Portland.

1872,From a reader in Hong Kong I was at the uneventful Legco Legislative Council demonstration on Saturday as well as last nights demonstrations between Causeway Bay and Central. It was as much depressing as ultimately uplifting. When I was incapacitated by a blast of pepper spray I somehow found myself being reverse crowd surfed to a safe area. There a young girl cradled my head and poured water into my eyes. Some others wiped the chemicals off my arms and legs. When they went on to help the next injured person an old woman kept watch over me speaking soft Cantonese and plying me with all manner of snacks and drinks. These were complete strangers. Later when we scrambled to avoid the first tear gas attack a small band of people committed to staying put and helping the crush of smoke victims climb over the concrete barriers and into safety. When we felt threatened we opened umbrellas and raised our hands. When the police decided to retake the street they sprayed chemicals in our faces pointed rifles at us smashed our limbs with batons. While they were throwing tear gas with reckless abandon our side threw not one rock not one bottle not one egg nothing. None from our side brandished a firearm a knife a club anything at all. I have neither seen nor heard any reports of protesters looting burning cars destroying property or intentionally injuring police. Young women felt safe enough to doze off during the lulls. In what other city would tens of thousands of rioters act with such restraint. The government warned against the chaos Occupy Central would cause. it is all too clear to me which side is supplying the chaos and which side is conducting itself with dignity. These demonstrations may have been sparked by anger but they are sustained by compassion and love. I have been working around the clock on a non China related magazine project and will wait until tomorrow to say something more about the consequential events underway in Hong Kong. It is of course interesting to note the spread of the hands up do not shoot. gesture from Ferguson to Hong Kong but the circumstances in the two places have 100 times more differences than similarities. There are profound differences as well with the other obvious comparison for mass movements among Chinese people namely the movements throughout China in the summer of 1989. What is happening in Hong Kong is uplifting for reasons this reader explains—and surprising for anyone who knows the generally non politicized nature of Hong Kong. But it is also quite a sobering time as soon as you think about the options open to the PRC government in Beijing and the instincts it has displayed in the face of all recent challenges of this sort. Beyond question this is a challenge that the still relatively new government of Mr 11 Xi Jinping has brought upon himself. That does not mean that it will end nicely. More tomorrow and overnight good wishes to those driven to such unexpected expressions in Hong Kong

813,Biebs may not be able to take Orlando Bloom in a bare knuckle fight but a grizzly bear poses no such problem to the pint sized pugilist Orlando Bloom may be glad to know he is not the only one who can not stomach Justin Bieber. The Lord of the Rings stars latest ally in his fallout with the pop loudmouth is a wild Russian Bear who found the singer truly unbearable. The beast had pounced on fisherman Igor Vorozhbitsyn and would have certainly have killed him until Igors phone went off and played Biebers hit Baby. So grisly did the mighty grizzly find the ringtone tune that it turned tail and fled back into the forest. Recounting his terrifying experience in northern Russias Yakutia Republic badly mauled Igor said I was walking to my fishing spot when there was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me. I could not believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled. My granddaughter had loaded the ringtone onto my phone for a joke. Wildlife experts believe it must have startled the bear into halting its attack. That ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear said one. Perhaps lifesaver Bieber should now dub himself Lord of the Ringtones
420,FISHERMAN Igor Vorozhbitsyn is lucky to be alive after his Justin Bieber ringtone went off while he was being attacked by a bear. Mr Vorozhbitsyn 42 thought he was a goner when the brown bear pounced on him as he was walking to a favourite fishing spot in northern Russias Yakutia Republic. But as the bear began to claw at him Mr Vorozhbitsyns mobile went off and the beast turned tail and fled back into the forest. Wildlife experts believe the ringtone according to local media the singers hit Baby must have startled the bear into halting its attack. Sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear explained one. Mr Vorozhbitsyn suffered from cuts and severe bruises to his face and chest and was rescued when he was found by other fishermen after using the phone to call for help. Mr Vorozhbitsyn now recovering from his mauling said I had parked my car and was walking towards the spot I had marked out when there was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me. I could not believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled. I know that sort of ringtone is not to everyones taste but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke he added

496,Citigroup analyst Jim Suva weighed in with his expectations for Apple Watch pricing following the news that Apple is hosting a media event on March 9. Apple already announced pricing will start at US 349—presumably for the Apple Watch Sport—and he thinks Apple Watch will cost 550 while the Apple Watch Edition will be priced at 950. he is also pegging April 16 as the smartwatchs official release date. Citigroup analyst thinks Apple Watch Edition will cost 950 not 5000Citigroup analyst thinks Apple Watch Edition will cost 950 not 5000 On Apples March 9 media event he said We expect Apple to give specifics on the launch time price and geographic locations which we estimate as Launch date April 16th Price points 350 550 and 950 with a launch limited to the US followed by Europe and Asia in the subsequent months. Setting Apple Watch Sport at 350 and the standard Apple Watch at 550 falls in line with the general consensus but the 950 price point he is targeting for Apple Watch Edition comes in well below expectations. Apple Watch Edition ships with a gold body instead of aluminium or stainless steel and is generally expected to start somewhere between 5000 and 10000. Mr Suva said he expects Apple will offer a wide variety of accessories for Apple watch with bands starting at 29 and topping out in the hundreds of dollars. He also thinks hundreds of apps will be available on launch day. He offered up his thoughts on which features we will see in Apple Watch when it launches saying We expect features to include Apple Pay adjustable notifications due to personal frequency and preferences Apple Health variable haptic feedback and battery life of one day. Shoppers hoping to be the first to get an Apple Watch will be able to buy theirs in Apples own retail stores and through the companys online store. Mr Suva expects Apples smartwatch will not be available through other retailers. Apple sent out media invitations on Thursday for a March 9 event teased as Spring forward which is a play on the Day Light Saving change happening on March 8 and likely a thinly veiled hint that we will be getting more Apple Watch news. When Apple first showed off its smartwatch last September we saw three models with a wide selection of bands support for tracking basic fitness activity such as steps and distance walked along with heart rate logging. Apple Watch will also offer Apple Pay support and will require an iPhone to perform many of its tasks. Mr Suva has a Buy rating on Apples stock along with a 135 target price. Apple is currently trading at 12959 down 082. Thanks to Barrons for the heads up The Mac Observer Spin Mr Suvas 950 price point for the gold Apple Watch Edition is surprisingly low compared to the general consensus that it will not start below 5000 and could cost more than 10000. we will have to wait until Apples March 9 media event where Apple Watch pricing is expected to be announced to see how close he really is

319,Rabat – Following some mens complaints about male strangers sitting next to their wives Saudi Arabian national airline Saudia is moving forward to segregate men and women on its airplanes. According to news360 Saudia will order staff to keep men and women segregated on board their planes unless they are close relatives. Multiple reports suggest that the policy change came in response to complaints from men unwilling to allow other males to sit next to their wives and other female family members. Saudi daily Ajel quoted Saudia assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd as saying that there are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers. This policy comes as part of Saudi Arabias culture of gender segregation which is deeply rooted in the mentality of minimizing the exposure of women in society. In Saudi Arabia women are not allowed to travel or work until they get their male guardians approval. Saudi Arabian women are not allowed to work as cabin crewmembers on Saudi Arabias national carriers. Instead Saudi Arabias national airlines employ women from other countries including Morocco as flight attendants

1193,Saudia Airlines the state run airline of Saudi Arabia does not have plans to separate passengers based on gender according to an airline source quoted in stories claiming the opposite. Several Gulf area and UK media outlets reported that the airline planned to seat unrelated men and women after receiving complaints. There are solutions to this problem Abdul Rahman Al Fahd an assistant marketing manager for Saudia was quoted as saying to Saudi Arabia daily Ajel. We will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers. Although Ajel reported that those solutions would include separating men and women unless they are closely related the source of the quote said the story was fabricated and that his quote was taken out of context. RunwayGirl JetwayMJ my name was mentioned there it is a total false and fabrication. — عبدالرحمن الفهـد January 2 2015 RunwayGirl a follower asked me how would the airline solve the issue of separate family seating that is a root of most delays I answered — عبدالرحمن الفهـد January 2 2015 RunwayGirl we are trying a solution and awaiting the outcomeIt is on how to rearrange splitting family members aboard but got twisted — عبدالرحمن الفهـد January 2 2015 The rumor was perhaps more believable after an incident last week when ultra Orthodox Jewish men delayed an Israel bound Delta flight because they refused to sit next to female passengers. And Saudi Arabia has persistent gender disparities The World Economic Forum ranked Saudi Arabia 127th out of 136 countries for womens rights in its Global Gender Gap Report in 2013. There are restrictions on women — for example they are not permitted to drive in the country — however there have also been signs of recent change.

1514,What began as an Occupy inspired student sit in exploded in Hong Kong over the weekend as police responded with excessive force toward peaceful demonstrators using tear gas pepper spray and rubber bullets. The Occupy Central protests spread from Hong Kongs financial district to just outside the citys government offices in Admiralty but the law enforcement crackdown had the opposite effect sending thousands more into the streets in solidarity and shutting down portions of the city. The protests have now bled into the work week and riot police have pulled back at least for now. Heres what you need to know so far. What started this. After 150 years of British rule Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997 but has operated semi autonomously under what is known as one country two systems outside of Beijings communist rule. The promise was that in 2017 Hong Kong would be allowed for the first time to elect its own leader in democratic elections instead of having the slot filled by a committee from Beijing. But earlier this summer China decided a committee was still necessary and it would select the candidates for Hong Kongs 2017 elections. Outrage has been building ever since. who is out there. The protests were organized in part by the Hong Kong Federation of Students which has since called for an indefinite student strike the New York Times reports. Young people are everywhere but not alone. The Hong Kong Professional Teachers Union has joined them with a general strike as have some professionals after the weekend violence — office workers in slacks and dress shirts mixed with crowds of students in black T shirts according to the Times. Occupy Central with Love and Peace meanwhile is led by a University of Hong Kong law professor named Benny Tai Businessweek reported earlier this summer. Tai has been organizing for months and a look at his planning from June now serves as some serious foreshadowing At some point Tai says the movement may follow through on the threat in its name and occupy Central where most of Hong Kongs top banks and other financial institutions have their offices. Many companies are already taking no chances developing plans in case demonstrators block the streets and prevent employees from getting to work. What do they want. In addition to democratic elections in 2017 and continued autonomy for Hong Kong as previously promised protesters are now demanding the resignation of current chief executive Leung Chun ying. The economics are also less than ideal and the country could be slipping into a recession. How is the government reacting. Not well especially at first. Heres a video from the ground of protesters being teargassed in attacks that look familiar from Ferguson and helped stoke outrage among citizens The use of pepper spray has been equally alarming and is reminiscent of previous Occupy protests in the US Hong Kong police officer grabs elderly protester turns and pepper sprays them full in the face http tco5l0pFtGGTF As Vox notes some protesters have taken to using the hands up do not shoot imagery of the Michael Brown demonstrations in Ferguson. it is still a powerful image on the other side of the world. attorneycrump Will you please show this to MikeBrowns parents let them know that he changed the WORLD. HongKong pictwittercom3u4FOSnp7x Protesters in Ferguson have sent a message back Heather a Ferguson protester wearing a sign that says Stay strong HongKong. pictwittercom9CnqFfERfL it is not surprising then that Beijing is blaming the West for stoking tensions. From the Times A commentary on the website of the Peoples Daily the Chinese Communist Partys main newspaper claimed that the upheavals in Hong Kong were instigated by democratic radicals who had sought support from anti China forces in Britain and the United States and had sought lessons from independence activists in Taiwan. It called them a gang of people whose hearts belong to colonial rule and who are besotted with Western democracy. Hong Kong has canceled its annual fireworks celebration of Chinas National Day on Wednesday indicating that this thing may continue for the foreseeable future. The protesters they are so young a mother of two who joined the protests on Monday told the Times. They are fighting for our future for my childrens future
2464,The cameras on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus may be some of the best on the smartphone market but they could be trumped by the camera on the next iteration of the iPhone. Though the next phone possibly the iPhone 6s is not expected for another eight months sources within Apple Incs supply chain in Asia have detailed a dual lens camera module according to Chinese publication UDN. Such a feature would improve the cameras low light performance and could also aid in optical image stabilization. Apple has long used a single lens with a five element design on its cameras. Minor camera upgrades on each new generation of iPhone have kept consumers satisfied. But in 2014 the manufacturer introduced a bigger update optical image stabilization and phase detection autofocus on the iPhone 6 Plus. The camera on the iPhone 6 Plus in particular is said to be on par with the image quality of point and shoot cameras. The iPhone 6 did not get that feature. Now Apple may provide the next iPhone with its largest camera upgrade in Apples history. Information out of Apples Asia supply chain has often been reliable in the past and tallies with prior reports suggesting that Apple will put a camera in the new iPhone that will rival the image quality of DSLR cameras. Daring Fireballs John Gruber said in November that Apple is working on a weird two lens system for a future iPhone. Devices like the HTC One M8 include a dual lens camera created by the Israeli startup Corephotonics. But Apple usually uses lenses by Sony. The iPhone 6s may also implement a feature called Force Touch according to the Taipei based touch module supplier TPK. Force Touch lets the Apple Watch interpret different levels of pressure for different actions a user can press heavily on the smartwatch screen to open an options menu and then use a light tough to select an option. The Apple Watch is expected to launch sometime in March
563,Oct 6 Hewlett Packard Co said it would split into two listed companies separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster growing corporate hardware and services operations. HP said its shareholders would own a stake in both businesses through a tax free transaction next year. Shares of the company which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing were up 51 percent at 37 in premarket trading on Monday. Each of the two businesses contribute about half of HPs current revenue and profit. The move will result in a monumental reshaping of one of technologys most important pioneers which has more than 300000 employees and is on track to book 112 billion in revenue the fiscal year ending October. Shareholders will now be able to invest in the respective asset groups without the fear of cross subsidies and inefficiencies that invariably plague large business conglomerates Ralph Whitworth former HP chairman and founder of Relational Investors LLC said in a statement. Relational owns a 149 percent stake in HP which had a market value of about 66 billion as of Friday. Many investors and analysts had called for a break up of the company or a sale of the personal computer business so that HP could focus on the more profitable operations of providing computer servers networking and data storage to businesses. HP is the latest in a line of companies often under shareholder pressure to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and capitalize on faster growing businesses. Online auction company eBay Inc said last week it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal. WHITMAN TO LEAD ENTERPRISE HPs current chief executive Meg Whitman will lead the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise which will house the corporate hardware and services operations. Current HP lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company. HPs printing and personal computing business to be known as HP Inc will be led by Dion Weisler currently an executive in that division. Whitman will be chairman of HP Inc. Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a Palo Alto California garage in 1939 HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the PC revolution. Lately however it has struggled to adapt to the shift towards mobile computing and it has been overshadowed by younger rivals such as Chinese PC maker Lenovo which is now the worlds No. 1 PC maker by shipments. Dell Inc which is HPs closest US competitor and facing similar pressure was taken private by founder Michael Dell last year. HPs PC business has shown signs of life in recent quarters growing broadly geographically as businesses replace aging machines. HP on Monday affirmed its fiscal 2014 adjusted earnings of 370 to 374 per share. It also forecast 2015 adjusted earnings of 383 403 per share in line with the average analyst estimate of 395 according to Thomson Reuters IBES. HPs announcement on Monday confirmed a report of the split in the Wall Street Journal on Sunday. Up to Fridays close HPs stock had risen nearly 26 percent this year.

681,A man at New York Citys LaGuardia Airport was removed from a plane after the Christmas spirit turned out to be too much for him.

He lectured the employee about how it was inappropriate to say that to everyone because not everyone celebrates the holiday. Unfortunately that was not the end of it.

That was the last straw. do not say Merry Christmas. the man raged before lecturing the attendants and the pilot about their faux pas. The crew was unable to calm the man and he was eventually removed from the flight. The flight left LaGuardia about 40 minutes late according to FlightAware. For proper greeting etiquette Mashable turns to Miss Manners who says annoyance at Merry Christmas is understandable but friendly overtures require pleasant replies. While some people are offended by Christmas because they do not celebrate it even more are offended by merry because they do not feel it she says.

441,The 28 year old took to Instagram Wednesday to blast a story on a parody site that stated she claimed Cosby molested her when they both appeared on The Cosby Show. This is truly a disgusting rumor that I want no part of Symone wrote. Raven Symone was the subject of a tasteless joke related to Bill Cosbys rape scandal — and she took to Instagram to fire back. The fake news site Hip Hop Hangover posted a story this week alleging that the actress had filed molestation charges against Cosby when both appeared on The Cosby Show. The article claimed the incident occurred after the 1992 series finale when she would have been around 6 years old. While the site has a disclaimer page in which it describes itself as a gossip parody and satirical publication it seems enough people were taking the report seriously that Symone felt compelled to speak out. On Wednesday the 28 year old blasted the report on her Instagram account. I was NOT taking advantage of by Mr Cosby when I was on the Cosby Show. I was practically a baby on that show and this is truly a disgusting rumor that I want no part of. Everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness. Now keep me out of this. A photo posted by Raven Symone on Nov 11 2014 at 220pm PST I was NOT taking advantage of by Mr Cosby when I was on the Cosby Show she captioned a photo of her Cosby Show character Olivia. I was practically a baby on that show and this is truly a disgusting rumor that I want no part of. she added. Everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness. Now keep me out of this. Symone is the first Cosby Show star pulled into her co stars ongoing scandal. Three women including former supermodel Janice Dickinson have publicly accused Cosby of assault after comedian Hannibal Buress called Cosby a rapist during a stand up gig in Philadelphia last month. In response to the backlash against the comedian Netflix announced Tuesday it was postponing airing a stand up comedy special featuring Cosby called Bill Cosby 77. On Wednesday NBC confirmed it had dropped plans to develop a new primetime comedy starring the actor. Cosby has never been criminally charged in any of the alleged rape cases. In 2006 a woman claimed he drugged and groped her. Cosby settled with the claimant out of court
2289,Updated 509 am Wednesday US officials say the video showing the beheading of a second US journalist by militants of the Islamic State is authentic. The US Intelligence Community has analyzed the recently released video showing US citizen Steven Sotloff and has reached the judgment that it is authentic National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement Wednesday. Original Post An Islamic radical group released a video on Tuesday that purportedly shows the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff. The Islamic State also known as ISIS or ISIL had threatened Sotloffs life when it released a video showing the beheading of American journalist James Foley two weeks ago. At the time the militants said Sotloffs life depended on the actions of the US government which has been targeting the group with airstrikes to stop its offensive in Iraq. SITE Intel Group which monitors jihadist groups posted a version of the video showing a man who looks like Sotloff kneeling next to a masked fighter holding a knife. In his regular briefing White House press secretary Josh Earnest said he was not in a position to confirm the authenticity of the video or the reports. Our thoughts and prayers are with Mr Sotloff and Mr Sotloffs family and those who worked with him Earnest said. The United States as you know has dedicated significant time and resources to try and rescue Mr. Sotloff. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the US would try to authenticate the video quickly. If the video is genuine we are sickened by this brutal act she said. Just last week Sotloffs mother released an emotional video in which she pleaded with the Islamic State to spare her sons life. Shirley Sotloff asked Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi to grant her son amnesty to use your authority to spare his life and to follow the example set by the Prophet Muhammad who protected people of the Book. According to The Washington Post Sotloff 31 was a freelance journalist covering the civil war in Syria when he was captured in 2013. On his Twitter account Sotloff described himself as a stand up philosopher from Miami whose work has been published in Time and Foreign Policy. Sotloffs mother said he was an honorable man who has always tried to help the weak.

1497,The woman who became a poster girl of Kurdish resistance in the city of Kobane is actually alive contrary to rumors spread by members of ISIS who claimed to have beheaded her. The woman who went by the name Rehana was seen as an image of hope in the city as it fought ISIS forces. An image of her giving the peace sign while dressed for battle went viral making her an international symbol. Just two days ago though ISIS militants claimed to have captured Rehana and killed her by beheading. They sent photos of members holding her head high alongside the ISIS flag. Friends of Rehana have come forward to put an end to the rumors and state that Rehana made it out of Kobane and is living in southern Turkey alive and well. She is my friend and I confirm that she is alive an anonymous source told MailOnline. And the picture of the beheaded female fighter is not Rehanas picture. She is in Turkey. I will try to gain her number because I lost connection with her. She evacuated Kobane and I stayed in Kobane. At the beginning of the last clashes Rehana left Kobane. Right now Kurdish Peshmerga fighters are battling for control of the border town Syrian Arab rebels have arrived in order to provide the Peshmerga with support. The US has also provided air support reportedly destroying five ISIS fighting positions and six vehicles. The Peshmerga and Syrian rebels apparently need further support though it is unknown if they will be able to receive it in time to save the city of Kobane. The only way to help Kobane since other countries do not want to use ground troops is sending some peace oriented or moderate troops to Kobane. What are they. Peshmerga … and Free Syrian Army Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told the BBC. Meanwhile news of Rehanas safety has reached SyrianKurdish journalist Rashad Abdel Qader who noted that she was fighting fiercely. Rehana 28 told reporters that she wanted to join the forces because she lost many friends to this and decided there was a need to join up. This is our land—our own—and if we do not do it who else will
1919,Lately Apple cEO has been making the rounds in Europe stopping at various stores and chatting with employees. Now and then we get tidbits of info about his chats. The last time we heard anything about his commentary on Apple Watch it was that he wore it in the shower suggesting it is a bit more water resistant than originally thought. Cook also said the Apple Watch was good for a full day of use. Now he is saying it will be available outside the US just after launch. According to unnamed employees Apples CEO says the Apple Watch will be available outside the US in April. Cook reportedly said this to Apple Store employees in Berlin and said specifically that the Apple Watch would come to Germany sometime in early April. There was no word on if any other countries or regions were specifically mentioned by Cook. This is another exciting piece to the puzzle for those anticipating big things from Apple on March 9. Though we have got quite a bit of insight on Apple Watch we do not know it all. So far Apple is busy erecting a tent just outside the events hall where they will give us more details on the Apple Watch next week. Though not necessarily confirmed as an Apple Watch hub the tent is reminiscent of the outdoor space Apple erected last Fall when they officially announced their wearable. Until we know for sure rumors of Apple Watch coming to more countries than the one I live in is exciting news. In the past Apple launched stateside before gently rolling their items to other countries. With an expected first run of 5 million Apple Watches though the company might have no reason not to let interested fans slap one on their wrist. Source 9to5Mac

1695,Hugh Hefner Founder and chief creative officer of Playboy Enterprises was found dead of natural causes Sunday morning at his home the Playboy Mansion in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles according to Los Angeles police officer Jimmy N Gardner. He was 88. Police responded to a call around 9 am PDT and confirmed Hefners identity from other residents of the Playboy Mansion Gardner said. Police are not releasing a more specific cause of death at this time. we will have to wait for an autopsy report for an official cause of death said Gardner. From what I have heard Mr Hefner was in good health for an 88 year old man. With no signs of foul play we are left to believe his death was of natural causes. Hefners long publication career first began as a copywriter for Esquire which was cut short in 1952 after being denied a 5 raise. Less than a year later after mortgaging his furniture and generating loans from everywhere from banks to even his mother Hefner launched Playboy. The racy magazine was nearly a hit from its first issue published in December 1953 which featured Marilyn Monroe from her 1949 nude calendar shoot and sold over 50000 copies. However the Playboy venture was not initially all fun and games. On June 4 1963 Hefner found himself in trouble with the law after being arrested for selling obscene literature after an issue of Playboy featuring nude shots of Jayne Mansfield was released. A jury was unable to reach a verdict. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for television and has made several movie appearances as himself. In 2009 he received a worst supporting actor nomination for a Razzie award for his performance in Miss March. Hefners death comes as a shock to millions. Despite his older age the Playboy tycoon was in excellent physical shape. Hefner was quoted as saying Life is too short to be living someone elses dream. As a pioneer in the industry this is a quote he took to heart. This story is still developing. More details will be made available once they emerge
317,Joan Rivers cardiac arrest may have been triggered by an unauthorized biopsy that the comedians personal physician — who apparently took a selfie in the operating room — performed on Rivers vocal cords CNN reported Tuesday citing unnamed sources close to the investigation. The 81 year old Rivers was at Yorkville Endoscopy clinic in Manhattan for a scheduled endoscopy by gastroenterologist Dr Lawrence Cohen to diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat. A source told CNN that after Cohen completed the procedure which involves putting a camera down the throat Rivers personal physician — an unidentified ear nose and throat specialist not certified by the clinic — stepped in to perform the vocal cord biopsy corroborating an earlier report by the Daily News. SEE ALSO Best of Joan Rivers Video Captures Her Most Memorable Moments CNN also reported that an unnamed clinic staff member told investigators that the personal physician took a selfie in the room while Rivers was under. CNNs source also said neither the gastroenterologist nor the ear nose and throat doctor had been accused of wrongdoing. A procedure such as a vocal cord biopsy requires patient consent and would only be authorized to take place in a hospital setting. The clinic released a statement last week saying no such biopsy was performed on Rivers and declined to respond to CNNs report citing federal privacy laws. However CNNs source said investigators are focusing on the biopsy and believe her vocal chords started swelling after the physician made a spur of the moment decision to remove a growth with a scalpel. The swelling may have cut off the flow of oxygen to her lungs which could have triggered cardiac arrest according to CNN and the Daily News. Rivers suffered cardiac arrest on Aug 29 and died a week later at Mount Sinai Hospital. Have something to add to this story. Share it in the comments

ISIS have held a number of towns and villages close to the Iraqi capital since earlier in the year when government troops melted away following a lightning advance in the west of the country enabling the terrorist group to seize further swaths of territory for their so called caliphate. Under attack An Iraqi army soldier aims his weapon during clashes with ISIS militants in Jurf al Sakhar 43 miles south of Baghdad at the weekend.

In a message posted on Facebook the group said The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad. They said it could never happen and now it almost has. Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to be hear a very short while to know they can do very very little they added. The claims were backed up by Canon White himself who shared the message just hours after he had earlier suggested the group were approximately six miles from the centre of Baghdad. In a message he also posted on Facebook Canon White had said The Islamic State are now within 10km of entering Baghdad. Over a 1000 Iraqi troops were killed by them yesterday things are so bad.

Approaching Reports that ISIS militants are now just one mile from Baghdad came from the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East an organisation supporting the work of Canon Andrew White Fear Canon Andrew White is the vicar of Baghdads St Georges Church the only Anglican church in Iraq. Earlier Canon White had claimed the terrorist group were six miles from the city No protection Canon Andrew White later updated his Facebook page questioning the ability of the Iraqi Army A female fighter pilot led Britains first combat mission against Islamic State. The woman who has not been named flew one of the RAF Tornados on the perilous sortie over jihadist held territory in northern Iraq on Saturday. Stationed at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus she is believed to be a weapons systems operator. She sits in the jets rear seat and fires the aircrafts Brimstone and Storm Shadow missiles and Paveway IV bombs. The airwoman who serves with II Squadron flies at exactly the same combat level as her male colleagues. A Ministry of Defence source said No one makes a big fuss of having a female pilot. We have females in aircrews and ground crews and they are here because of their abilities. Everyone is just doing their jobs. The involvement of a woman RAF pilot comes amid reports that the family of Major Mariam Al Mansouri of the United Arab Emirates who flew an F 16 jet in bombing raids against positions in Syria last week has disowned her. The news comes as RAF jets flew armed sorties for a second day over Iraq yesterday – but again failed to locate any suitable targets for their weapons. Defence chiefs insisted that the flights by Tornado GR4 fighter bombers were invaluable for gathering intelligence on the Islamist jihadists who have swept across large swathes of Iraq and Syria carrying out massacres. But the failure to unleash any firepower has fuelled concern that Britain is failing to pull its weight in the international coalition against Islamic State It came as military commanders warned that Britain should brace itself to be dragged into a ground war in Iraq to crush IS which is also known as Isis and Isil. Former top brass also warned that the air campaign would be futile unless the UK could target the terrorists in Syria. While the Ministry of Defence confirmed that the RAFs third mission had – like on Saturday – failed to locate any targets US led coalition aircraft targeted four makeshift oil refineries under IS control in Syria as well as a command centre. The mobile refineries generate up to £12million a day for the militants. On a mission The RAF jets seek out their terror targets in Iraq which they failed to find and bomb again Strong presence Military leaders have said about two thirds of the estimated 31000 Islamic State militants were in Syria. But ISIS have held a number of towns and villages close to the Iraqi capital since earlier in the year when government troops melted away following a lightning advance in the west of the country Meanwhile US President Barack Obama has acknowledged that US intelligence agencies underestimated the threat posed by ISIS extremists in Syria and overestimated the capabilities of the Iraqi army. Obama added that breaking up the terrorist cell will be a complicated battle involving both military and political action. The president spoke about the multi national effort against ISIS in a televised interview with 60 Minutes which aired Sunday night. Citing earlier comments by James Clapper director of national intelligence Mr Obama acknowledged that US intelligence did not take seriously enough what had been taking place in Syria. Well I think our head of the intelligence community Jim Clapper has acknowledged that I think they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria Mr Obama said. Conversely the United States overestimated the ability of the Iraqi army to fight the militant groups Obama said in the interview taped on Friday days after the president made his case at the United Nations for action. President Obama says the US intelligence agencies underestimated Islamic State activity in Syria and overestimated the Iraqi armys role to fight back against militants Speaking to CBSs 60 Minutes he said the militants had used the chaos of the Syrian civil war when large swathes of the country were ungoverned to reconstitute themselves Militants The terrorist group ISIS has been taking large swaths of Syria and Iraq in the recent absence of a permanent US military presence in Iraq The US led coalition fighting the Islamic State group is growing with dozens of countries among its ranks. The coalition is contributing a wide range of efforts from carrying out airstrikes to providing military assistance and humanitarian aid. Here are some of the key partners in the coalition. UNITED STATES The US which is leading the coalition has launched dozens of airstrikes on Islamic State targets. It also has sent military advisers supplies and humanitarian aid to help Iraqi troops and Kurdish forces beat back the insurgents. GULF STATES Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have participated in airstrikes in Syria. A fourth Qatar has played what the Pentagon called a supporting role. The Emirates and Qatar also host air bases that are being used for the coalitions aerial campaign against the Islamic State group. US Navy ships involved in the airstrikes are assigned to the Bahrain based Fifth Fleet. Saudi Arabia has agreed to host training facilities for Syrian rebels on its territory. JORDAN Jordan has launched airstrikes against Islamic State positions with government spokesman Mohammad al Momani calling the move necessary in light of continuous attempts to infiltrate our borders. The kingdom did not give any specifics about its operations but said the airstrikes aim to insure the countrys security. EGYPT Egypt has not announced any specific participation in airstrikes but President Abdel Fattah el Sissi told the AP that Egypt is completely committed to giving support and will do whatever is required to support the coalition. ISRAEL Israel is offering intelligence estimates and concrete intelligence to the US on the Islamic State group as part of ongoing intelligence sharing between the two countries an Israeli defense official said. But he added Israel was not asked to contribute anything beyond that. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue. The prime ministers office declined to comment. BRITAIN Britain said that Tornado fighter bombers supported by air to air refueling aircraft and signals intelligence are operating over Iraq. Britains media has widely reported that six warplanes are on standby in Cyprus but defense officials have declined to offer specific numbers. Ben Goodlad from IHS Janes has said that the Tornado jets offer the coalition enhanced capability to engage moving targets. Britain also has two weapons for long range strikes the Tornados Storm Shadow cruise missile and the submarine launched Tomahawk cruise missile he said. FRANCE France has carried out airstrikes in Iraq on two occasions since joining the US led coalition on Sept 19 firing laser guided bombs from Rafale fighter planes upon munitions and military hardware stockpiles — first near northern Mosul then on Thursday near Fallujah. France is conducting the operations in Iraq from a French air base in the United Arab Emirates. The base with about 750 French service personnel and six Rafales is 1700 kilometers from Mosul meaning that the planes need refueling in flight to strike in Iraq. AUSTRALIA An Australian air force contingent including eight FA 18 Hornet jet fighters and two support aircraft has arrived in the United Arab Emirates. About 600 troops — most of them air force personnel — are being deployed with the aircraft. The jets are expected to be used in airstrikes against Islamic State fighters in Iraq although the Australian government has yet to commit to a combat role. BELGIUM Six F 16 multirole fighters and a contingent of 120 support staff including eight pilots to be based in Jordan.

784,Saudi Arabias national carrier has reportedly decided to impose separate seating on its male and female passengers. The plan is being implemented by Saudi Airlines due to a rash of complaints from men who said they did not want their wives sitting next to other men the Daily Mail reported citing Gulf media. There are solutions to this problem… we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers Saudi Airlines assistant manager for marketing Abdul Rahman Al Fahd was quoted as saying. According to the report close relatives will be allowed to sit together. The plan reportedly also follows recent complaints from male passengers about a flirty flight attendant. Saudi women are not employed as flight attendants by the airline which instead hires women from other countries the report said. Saudi Arabia enforces a strict segregation of the sexes in public spaces and famously forbids women from driving motor vehicles. Women are required to wear a headscarf and loose black robes in public. Operators of flights to and from Israel have faced similar complaints from men who refused to sit next to women. An international flight from New York to Tel Aviv was delayed for half an hour on December 20 after ultra Orthodox Jewish men refused to sit between two women. The flight crew of Delta Flight 468 departing John F Kennedy Airport attempted to find other seats for the men. But other passengers refused to swap seats in protest at their refusal to sit next to female passengers according to a Friday report by Israel Radio. The men were finally accommodated by an American passenger who agreed to switch seats. According to Federal Aviation Authority regulations a flight is not permitted to take off until all passengers are seated. In September an El Al flight was grounded after a group of ultra Orthodox men refused to sit next to a female passenger resulting in an 11 hour delay described as a nightmare by passengers. That incident sparked a petition calling on EL AL to protect its female travelers by reserving a few rows of separate sex seating on every flight where for a fee those passengers who need such seating can pre book their seats and not annoy or coerce other passengers before take off to change seats with them — thereby avoiding arguments bullying and delayed take off
1993,Apple is the sort of company to be so obsessive about the devices they create that they had make their own type of metal to perfect them. that is what they do. they have already done it. Apple uses cold forged steel in one iteration of their new Apple Watch. According to Jony Ive they are also bringing their own specially prepared gold to the smartwatch as well. Not that this new gold is anything you had need a new magical alchemy to concoct this is just a matter of preparation and process. The Apple Watch comes in several different editions. One of them is called Apple Watch Edition. The Edition collection says Apple features six uniquely elegant expressions of Apple Watch. Apple notes that each of these devices has a watch case crafted from 18 karat gold that they say their metallurgists have developed to be up to twice as hard as standard gold. gold2 Jony Ive corroborates this in a story posted by The Financial Times this week. In this story Ive explains how the molecules in Apple gold are closer together making it twice as hard as standard gold. that is how hardness works after all. fancy As mentioned by Ars Technicas Jonathan M Gitlin Apple filed patent application 20140361670 back in June of 2013 for a Method and apparatus for forming a gold metal matrix composite which has an abstract which reads as follows A metal matrix composite using as one of the components a precious metal is described. In one embodiment the precious metal takes the form of gold and the metal matrix composite has a gold mass fraction in accordance with 18 k magic The metal matrix composite can be formed by blending a precious metal powder and a ceramic powder forming a mixture that is then compressed within a die having a near net shape of the metal matrix composite. The compressed mixture in the die is then heated to sinter the precious metal and ceramic powder. The abstract also contains mention of diamond powder. So do not worry about your fabulous 18k gold being lessened by the likes of peasant materials. Other techniques for forming the precious metal matrix composite using HIP and a diamond powder are also disclosed. gold2222 Sound alright to you. Just so long as the gold has a gold mass friction in accordance with 18k we are good to go yes. Stay tuned to our Apple Hub portal for coverage of the Apple Event from San Francisco on Monday the 9th of March 2015 that is less than a couple of days away from now

1188,BlackBerry has interested Lenovo for some time and it seems like the Chinese company is gearing up once more to attempt an acquisition BlackBerry Ltd could be an acquisition target for Lenovo says a report from Benzinga citing a source familiar with the news. According to the report the Chinese group will make an offer of 15 per share to the BlackBerry as early as this week with the deal finally getting done at around 18 per share. BlackBerry Lenovo plans smart devices On Wednesday Lenovo stated that it is planning to launch its internet based smart devices on Apr. 1 2015. Also it was reported that the company will operate under a separate name and brand. A BlackBerry spokesperson told Benzinga that the company would not respond to rumors or speculations and a Lenovo spokesperson was not available for the comment. Lenovo CFO Wong Wai Ming said in January 2013 that the Canadian smartphone maker was under consideration from the company. However BlackBerry declined any such possibility that time. Only last year the government banned a potential BlackBerry deal with Lenovo due to some national security issues. BlackBerry shipment estimates lowered Recently analyst Todd Coupland at CIBC World Markets speculated that the estimated shipment volume for BlackBerry devices for the third and fourth quarters would be weak. Coupland added though that the initial demand for the BlackBerry Passport is encouraging compared to modest expectations. Coupland noted that on Google Trends there was an increased search interest for the device that was similar to the BB10s number two devices. Also the Canadian company sold an unexpected 200000 units of the Passport on the very first day of its launch. Coupland said Shipments however are being held back by supply constraints for unique screens and keyboards that will limit any upside in fiscal Q3. According to the analyst demand for BB7 and Z30 devices of BlackBerry is going down therefore shipment forecasts for BlackBerry devices have been revised down from 23 million units to 16 million units for the third quarter. Additionally for the fourth quarter his shipment estimate is down from 25 million units to 15 million. BlackBerry CEO John Chen is expecting total shipments to hit 10 million units annually by 2017. Coupland says that the company still has a lot to do to revive its position in hardware before it can achieve its target and expects the company to ship only 68 million units in 2016 and 2017
2335,Tampa Florida she is an Internet sensation Jasmine Tridevil the 21 year old Tampa woman who claims to have had a third breast implanted. Her video on YouTube has almost a million hits and her pictures on Facebook have gone global. 10 News spoke with her in an exclusive interview. I figured people would be skeptical but it is true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show said Tridevil. She agreed to the interview on the condition we only discuss her self produced show she hopes will be picked up by a cable network and when we asked to see her third breast she obliged but with only a quick flash. When asked her why we could not have a longer look Tridevil responded I am not ready to do that right now because it is in episode six of my show. Some of the comments from the public have been cruel. Tridevil says she predicted that but she is willing to do whatever it takes to be famous. Dr Dan Greenwald of Bayshore Plastic Surgery in Tampa says that raises a lot of red flags. I think its very extreme and that leads me to wonder why she needs this attention. Is there some instability. Is there something psychologically lacking or out of balance for this person said Greenwald. And Jasmines reaction to that. I saw it coming.

1490,Jasmine Tridevil claims to have had plastic surgery that gave her a third boob but a cosmetic surgeon is calling her bluff. Even though the addition of another breast is theoretically possible it is not plausible. I believe 100 percent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for Dr Matthew Schulman a board certified plastic surgeon in New York told the Daily Dot. I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible. There are two main reasons the doctor is skeptical about Tridevils story. The first is the photographic evidence of the third breast has been taken by Tridevil and posted on her personal Facebook page. The lighting is dim and the photos easily could have been altered the Daily Dot wrote. Second creating a third breast would require placement of a tissue expander beneath the skin between her two breasts to make a pocket for the false breast. It would take about six months for this to happen and then the spacer could be replaced with an implant. Schulman said multiple surgeries would need be required. When asked about her surgery Tridevil simply said she had it done a few months ago. She did not mention anything about an expander or how long it took for the surgery. The final bit of evidence that suggests Tridevils third breast is fake was the final result. This technique would create a tight round breast in the center of the chest he said. Also all three breasts will likely be connected because it would be impossible to create and maintain separation between all three round structures. The photos show a soft pendulous breast that is clearly separate from the right and left breast. She essentially has a hanging breast and it is just not reflective of what we would be able to expect from this reconstruction procedure. During a radio interview Tridevil refused to give her real name but Snopes pointed out she has a striking resemblance to Alisha Hessler the person to whom JASMINETRIDEVILcom is registered. Hessler made headlines in 2013 after she publicly shamed a man who allegedly assaulted her Snopes wrote. She reportedly made a man hold a sign that said I beat women. She withdrew her complaint with the police department after she was asked for details about the alleged attack Buzzfeed wrote. Tridevil said on her Facebook account Tuesday Alisha Hessler is her real name. She also said the news story is real and she was arrested for using someone elses identification to get into a club. I was underage and wanted to get drunk lol she wrote. She told The Sun her claim is not a hoax and her film crew recorded her procedure. She said she will release the footage when she gets a reality television show and I really do not care what people say about me. Follow me on Twitter mariamzzarella

1082,we are at a loss for words right now. Our hearts are completely broken by this news. 17 year old transgender teen Leelah Alcorn also known as Joshua Alcorn was killed after being struck by a tractor trailer on a highway in Ohio around 230 am. The death however was NOT accidental. Leelah took her own life and detailed exactly why she was killing herself in a lengthy and heart shattering suicide note posted to her tumblr page. Related Salvation Army Documents Show LGBTQ Discrimination After explaining to her followers why exactly they were seeing the note she revealed she took her own life because she was never accepted for being transgender. Especially from her family. Some of the more gut wrenching parts of her note are as follows When I was 14 I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom and she reacted extremely negatively telling me that it was a phase that I would never truly be a girl that God does not make mistakes that I am wrong. If you are reading this parents please do not tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people do not ever say that to someone especially your kid. That will not do anything but make them hate them self. that is exactly what it did to me…. When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday when I did not receive consent from my parents to start transitioning I cried myself to sleep. I formed a sort of a fuck you attitude towards my parents and came out as gay at school thinking that maybe if I eased into coming out as trans it would be less of a shock. Although the reaction from my friends was positive my parents were pissed. They felt like I was attacking their image and that I was an embarrassment to them. They wanted me to be their perfect little straight christian boy and that is obviously not what I wanted… I have decided I have had enough. I am never going to transition successfully even when I move out. I am never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I am never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I am never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I am never going to find a man who loves me. I am never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. there is no winning… that is the gist of it that is why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that is not a good enough reason for you it is good enough for me. As for my will I want 100 of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups I do not give a shit which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people are not treated the way I was they are treated like humans with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say that is fucked up and fix it. Fix society. Please. Leelah shall not be forgotten. Her life will NOT be in vain.

If you or someone you know is on the verge of committing suicide please urge them to call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1 273 8255 or visit their website HERE. Image via Leelahs Tumblr

A parody website posted a story earlier this week claiming Raven was telling people Cosby had sexually assaulted her which is especially sick considering she was only 3 years old when she debuted as Huxtable granddaughter Olivia.

356,Technology giant Hewlett Packard will break in two according to sources cited by The Wall Street Journal on Sunday. The company will reportedly be divided between its PC and printers units and its corporate hardware and services operations. Hewlett Packard will announce the separation as early as Monday according to WSJ. The split is the latest in a series of high profile technology breakups following close on the heels of eBays decision to spin off PayPal last week. Many expect better performance when a large company becomes focused on a more limited number of business lines. Meg Whitman will be CEO of the corporate hardware and services company and act as chairman of the PC and printer company according to the WSJs sources. Dion Weisler will be CEO of the PC side and Patricia Russo will be chairman of the corporate side. HP has considered splitting up for years. An HP spokesperson said the company had no comment when contacted by The Huffington Post
617,Beats Music will eventually disappear as a brand according to a new report. TechCrunch reports that Apple plans to eliminate the Beats Music streaming service which it acquired in May but does not say when. The report is less clear on what Apple plans to do with streaming music. Once source tells TechCrunch that on demand music could be integrated into iTunes another source says Apple will make a significant music announcement in the first half of 2015. Engineers from Beats Music have already been transferred to other divisions at Apple including iTunes according to the report. As TechCrunch notes Beats Music CEO Ian Rogers was put in charge of Apples ad supported iTunes Radio product in August and has been splitting his time between the services since then. When Apple bought the Beats brand for 3 billion Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue called Beats Music the first music subscription service done right. Though it mostly mimicked existing services from Spotify Rdio and others Beats Music tried to differentiate itself through hand curated playlists and the involvement of music industry titans like Dr Dre and Trent Reznor. But after three months it had only 250000 subscribers compared to over 10 million on Spotify. Still Cue had positioned Beats as a key component of Apples music strategy saying that the company wanted to offer on demand listening along with ad supported radio and digital downloads. All of which suggests that while the Beats Music brand may be going away on demand streaming from Apple could easily take another form. If iTunes is remade as a kind of celestial jukebox that combines your MP3s and on demand streaming into a single place the Beats Music brand going away might not be such a bad thing after all. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. This article originally appeared on The Verge

231,Joan Rivers doctor took a selfie with the unconscious comedian in the operating room before her endoscopy according to a new report from CNN. The ear nose and throat specialist who has not been publicly identified was also allowed to perform a biopsy on her vocal cords a procedure that Rivers had not previously approved and which may have led to her cardiac arrest. Citing a source close to the death investigation CNN reports that the doctor was allowed into the operating room at Yorkville Endoscopy although he was not affiliated with the clinic in any way. While there the source added he took a selfie photo in the procedure room while Rivers was under anesthesia. After Dr Lawrence Cohen medical director of Yorkville finished performing the procedure on Rivers he stepped aside and allowed the ear nose and throat specialist to biopsy her vocal cords. During that procedure CNN says her vocal cords began to swell cutting off oxygen to her lungs and leading to her cardiac arrest. Yorkville Endoscopy previously released a statement denying that Rivers vocal cords were being biopsied when she went into cardiac arrest. The statement did not address reports that Rivers personal doctor was allowed in the operating room. Yorkvilles medical director Dr Lawrence Cohen who was performing the endoscopy on Rivers has already stepped down from his position. Neither he nor Rivers doctor have been accused of any wrongdoing by the state Health Department officials investigating Rivers death. Image via Associated Press
223,The appearance of Path founder Dave Morin in the front row of Tuesdays iPhone 6 launch event has added credibility to a Pando report that says Apple is about to acquire the struggling social network. Morin tweeted a selfie of him and Dr Dre who has previously occupied the front row slot. Dres Beats Entertainment was Apples last acquisition. Pando writes According to a single well placed source inside Apples engineering team the company is poised to announce an acquisition of Dave Morins Path social network. To quote our source who requested to remain anonymous because the deal has not been announced yet it is almost done if not signed already but it is essentially a done deal. Until recently Path was all but written off by most people. The social network which limits users to an exclusive ring of just 150 friends laid off 20 of its staff a year ago and has gathered only 25 million users. More recently Morin told BuzzFeed that Path maybe failed Did the experiment fail. Maybe he told BuzzFeed News. Are we trying to take new approaches to the interface and approach it different ways than we did before. Absolutely. . I think failure is a big part of life and being human the best thing we can do is keep moving forward. Pando reports that Paths social network function might by incorporated into a revamped Messages app. Path and Apple have a history. It was a screwup by Path in which the app by default uploaded iPhone users entire contacts lists that required Apple CEO Tim Cook to answer letters from Congress about Apples efforts to protect user privacy
576,Despite being heavy competitors with each other Samsung and Apple do quite a bit more business with each other than some might realize Samsung has long been a supplier of some Apple product components for iPhones and iPads and back in January they were rumored to be providing Apple the S1 system in package chipset for the Apple watch that debuts later this year. Now there are reports stating that through their Samsung Display arm they may become a future supplier to Apple for displays of the Apple watch. The report also states that LG Display will actually be the first provider of the OLED displays that the Apple watch is said to be using. LG Display also currently makes displays for the iPad. As we stated above this would not be the first time that we have seen Apple work alongside its competitors let alone two of its biggest competitors to bring one of its own devices to market. Apple of course had to get the Apple watch displays from somewhere because they do not make their own displays for their products and seeing as how both Samsung and LG have already produced more than one smartwatch themselves along with the displays on them should these rumors be true it actually makes a lot of sense. Currently the Apple Watch is not available but it is reportedly going on sale this year in April and for the time being the rumor states that LG will be the sole supplier at first. what is more is that Samsung is reported to be joining in on the display sales sometime as early as the second half of 2015 or very early 2016 potentially for the next version of the Apple watch although at this point in time Samsung and LG have both declined to comment on these rumors stated in the South Korean media. Apple has kept quiet on the matter as well. Whether or not there is any truth to these rumors seems to be uncertain for now but knowing that Apple buys display tech from LG Display already the rumors are reasonable enough to be at least plausible and it is certainly possible for LG Display to make more screens for other Apple products

1124,it is a well known fact that a womans jealousy is not something to be underestimated and that applies all the more so to a scorned wife who has been cheated on by her husband. In a bizarre but true illustration of that edict a jealous wife in China 30 year old Feng Lung reported chopped her husbands penis off with a pair of sharp scissors not once but twice in order to teach him a lesson for his infidelity. Having found out her husband was cheating on her the woman sliced off his penis which was reattached successfully by surgeons in Shangqiu in central Chinas Henan province. When she saw her husband had sent a raunchy email to his mistress once again she severed his member a second time. Lung is now facing jail after being arrested for causing grievous bodily harm to her husband 32 year old Fan Lung. The Mirror reports that surgeons were able to reattach the penis but when the jealous wife found the email on her phone she reportedly sneaked into his hospital room and cut it off again before throwing it out of a window. The man ran outside the hospital to confront his wife and to find his severed penis. He was seen naked and pouring with blood in the street outside the facility. A hospital spokesman told reporters The first we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital. Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman. He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again. Despite an extensive search by police officers at the scene the mans penis was never located and authorities believe it may have been eaten by a stray dog or cat. The hospital spokesman added The man had lost a lot of blood and was taken in for emergency surgery. He is now in a stable condition but is extremely emotionally distraught
215,—The cardiac arrest leading to Joan Rivers death happened as the comedians personal doctor began performing a biopsy on her vocal cords a source close to the death investigation told CNN. JOAN RIVERS THROUGH THE YEARS Joan Rivers blurb Joan Rivers has passed away at the age of 81. Take a look at the life of the legendary comedienne. MORE CELEBRITIES PAY TRIBUTE TO JOAN RIVERS Joan Rivers last show Celebrities took to social media to share their thoughts about comedian Joan Rivers death. Take a look at some of the tributes posted to Twitter. MORE A staff member at Manhattans Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators that the doctor who has not been publicly identified took a selfie photo in the procedure room while Rivers was under anesthesia the source said. Rivers 81 was at the clinic for a scheduled endoscopy by another doctor gastroenterologist Dr Lawrence Cohen. That procedure intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat involved the insertion of a camera down her throat. After Cohen the clinics medical director finished his work a biopsy was done on Rivers without her prior consent according to the source. An ear nose and throat specialist not certified by the clinic as required by law performed a biopsy on her vocal cords. The doctor is described by the source as Rivers personal ear nose throat physician. Even though you are a licensed physician you still should have if you will the checks and balances to get your approval to practice in that particular place said Dr Arthur Caplan a medical ethicist at New York Universitys Langone Medical Center. Investigators believe that Rivers vocal chords began to swell during the allegedly unauthorized biopsy cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs which led to cardiac arrest on the morning of August 29 the source said. Rivers 81 was rushed by paramedics from Yorkville Endoscopy to New Yorks Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away where she died a week later. Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement last Thursday denying reports that any vocal cord biopsy has ever been done at the clinic although federal privacy law prevented any patient information from being released. The day after the denial was issued the clinic confirmed that Dr Cohen is not currently performing procedures nor is he currently serving as medical director. The source said that at this time neither Cohen nor the ear nose and throat doctor have been accused of wrongdoing by investigators. The clinic declined to respond to the sources comments about a biopsy or a selfie citing federal privacy law
71,The next iPhones camera may see a massive leap in image quality Apple Insider reports — if it gets the rumoured inclusion of optical image zoom for the first time. The Apple news site is basing its report off rumours heard by the Japanese language UDN and its ever reliable sources in the Asian supply chain. Currently the iPhone — like almost every other smartphone — makes use of digital zoom. With digital zoom zooming in does not add any extra detail to your photo — it just enlarges and enhances what is already captured. In contrast optical zoom uses an actual lens to to magnify and capture significantly more detail without sacrificing image quality. The camera in the iPhone 6 is already highly praised but the rumoured new version will reportedly make use of a new dual lens system to aid magnification — like compact cameras and professional SLRs. it is a rumour in keeping with what we have already heard about the next iPhone. Blogger and developer John Gruber who has an excellent track record on Apple product news said that the next model may have the biggest camera jump ever. I have heard that it is some kind of weird two lens system where the back camera uses two lenses Gruber said and it somehow takes it up into DSLR quality imagery. And that is not the only new prediction about the next iPhone from UDN. The Apple smartphone is also reportedly to include Force Touch a pressure sensitive touchscreen which is also included in the Apple Watch. A user could press lightly on an app to load it or push more forcefully in order to bring up more options for example
1033,Raven Symone did NOT file molestation charges against Bill Cosby. A hoax report that has gone viral amid renewed rape allegations against Cosby claims the former child star revealed to the TMZ offices that she too had been raped and drugged by Cosby following the final episode of The Cosby Show. The story is 100 percent false and fake. The actress herself took to Instagram on Wednesday to shoot down the story I was NOT taking advantage of by Mr Cosby when I was on the Cosby Show. I was practically a baby on that show and this is truly a disgusting rumor that I want no part of. Everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness. Now keep me out of this. TMZ has nothing to do with the original phony story. It was started by something called Hip Hop Hangover an unfunny parody site and then shared more than 100000 times on Facebook. Large outlets like the Indian version of International Business Times picked it up and treated the fake allegations like they were real. The post contains phony quotes from a purported lawyer for Raven Symone including a fake press announcement that declares We among so many others are tired of the media worshipping and praising a man that has a past so terrible that it is unbelievable. My client is also ready to tell her side of the story. A side that was kept quiet because of threats from being blackballed. No actual lawyer for the real Raven Symone ever made such a statement. Again Raven Symone has NOT actually claimed Cosby molested or raped her. The article is a hoax timed to exploit the very serious allegations against Cosby by women including Janice Dickinson and Joan Tarshis. it is appalling that outlets would spread this satirical story about Raven Symone without checking first
1773,Argentinean President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner officially became the godmother of a Jewish boy last Tuesday. But the reasons behind the ceremonial act have gotten blurred with folklore about werewolves in South America. It was reported that the adoption was connected to an ancient legend or myth where the seventh son born after six boys becomes a werewolf. Turns out there is a custom involving Argentinas President taking god children and a myth about werewolves and other than involving seventh sons they are unrelated according to a report in the Guardian Monday. According to Argentinian custom the countrys president takes the seventh child of Argentine families as a godchild. The honor only applied to Catholic children before 2009. According to reports Kirchner took Yair Tawil as a godson after his parents were initially denied in their request in 1993. He appealed and last week became the first Jewish god son of the countrys president. Earlier reports including one in UPI explained that according to Argentinian legend the seventh son in a daughter less family will turn into a werewolf on his 13th birthday. The legend became so feared that families would abandon or kill their sons the UPI story stated. To counteract this stigma the president of Argentina began in 1907 to adopt one of the boys as their godson. But Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda told the Guardian that the two traditions are not actually linked. The local myth of the lobizón is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president he explained. According to Balmaceda the later custom was actually started in the early 1900s by German and Russian emigres who brought the tradition to Argentina from Europe.

The march into the largest city in the country comes on the heels of President Barack Obama admitting that the threat of the group was underestimated. The fighting near the city has become fierce as reports from inside the Middle East region maintain the Islamic State fighters are just about to reach the doorstep of Baghdad. The ISIS fighters have already garnered a large portion of both Iraq and Syria but some experts fear that a takeover by the Islamic State in Baghdad could prove disastrous for the United States. Thwarting the reach of the group could prove significantly more difficult if Baghdad with a population of about 7 million falls under the complete control of ISIS. The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad. They said it could never happen and now it almost has Canon Andrew White a priest leading the only Anglican church in the Iraq city said. Obama says he overstated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to here a very short while to know that they can do very very little The Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East member added. Islamic State militants took over the control of Mosul the second largest city in Iraq. Massive fighting is still ongoing in Fallujah – a town about 25 miles away from Bagdad. BBC News is reporting that Iraqi troops are fighting ISIS militants approximately six miles away from Baghdad. If reports from the news agency are accurate the Iraqi Army could barely contain the ISIS fighters or force a retreat even with the airstrikes offered by the United States. During the 60 Minutes interview President Obama had this to say about ISIS and the turmoil in the Middle East. During the chaos of the Syrian civil war where essentially you had huge swaths of the country that are completely ungoverned they ISIS were able to reconstitute themselves and take advantage of that chaos. ISIS is sort of a hybrid of not just the terrorist network but one with territorial ambitions and some of the strategy and tactics of an army. According to Obama administration military advisers ISIS now numbers about 40000 fighters – all of which have sworn allegiance to Abu Bakr al Baghdadi and his plan to create an Islamic caliphate. What do you think about ISIS being one mile away from Baghdad. Image via Shutterstockcom
994,A new TV show in Peru has captured the moment unwitting men have been caught wolf whistling their own mothers. The experiment took two mothers whose sons were identified as repeat cat callers and disguised them using make up wigs and clothes. The women then women walked past their sons to gauge their reaction. The mother wearing a disguise of a wig and sunglasses walks past her unsuspecting son and a friend before he makes a comment towards her The mother then goes over to confront her child who is still unaware the woman is actually his parent The man acts in horror as he realises it is his own mother and she launches into a tirade accusing him of being dirty The mother gets so angry with her son she then takes off her bag and proceeds to hit him with it due to this behaviour In the first case the mother is dressed in a short black dress and walks past her son and a friend in the street. The son then unwittingly makes a comment at his mother saying tasty panties which prompts her to go and confront him. She then removes her sunglasses and the man then realises he has just cat called his own mother. The mother then launches into a tirade accusing him of being dirty and saying she never taught him to talk to women in that manner. Another mother wearing a black wig walks past her son who is standing working on the streets of Lima After making a remark towards his mother she then turns around and goes over to confront him She then takes off her wig to reveal herself and then throws it on the floor in anger after being disgusted by her sons behaviour The mother then tells her son he should be ashamed of himself for speaking to her like that as he pleads with her to calm down She then gets so angry with her child that she then removes her bag and hits him with it. Meanwhile in the second case the mother wearing a green dress walks past her son who calls her piggy. She then calls his name before taking off her wig and confronting her son hitting him with her hairpiece. The man then tries to claim he did not make the remark but is then forced to apologise to his mother before she walks off She too launches into a tirade telling her son to he should be ashamed of himself while he pleads with his mother to quieten down as he is working. He then tries to claim he did not make the remark and it a man in a nearby car but he eventually apologises before his mother walks off. The video ends with a warning saying men should start respecting women before they unwittingly harass their own mothers. It comes after the video claims that seven in 10 women say they have experienced sexual harassment on the streets of the Peruvian capital Lima
1677,BlackBerry takeover rumours are nothing new and this week Lenovo could be the company lining up to take over the struggling Canadian manufacturer. As far as rumours go it has potential. After all Lenovo tried to purchase the company back in October last year. Ultimately Lenovo was blocked by the Canadian government because BlackBerrys telecom infrastructure has ties to national security. Now though a source familar with the matter has given Benzinga the heads up that Lenovo is prepared to try again. Bailing out the Berry. According to the site the Chinese company is prepared to offer 1500 a share as an initial offer and finish with a done deal at 1800 per share. Moreover the rumours proclaim the deal will be done as soon as this week. Unsurprisingly neither company has commented on this rumour. Optimistic market watchers might point to BlackBerrys re emergence care of new CEO John Chen and the new BlackBerry Passport flagship phone. However the company has still seen a huge decline in its user base and is not in an enviable position compared to cash rich tech rivals. Lenovo for its part seems to be on a bit of a mobile spending spree. The company bought Motorola Mobility from Google for around 291 billion at the start of the year. we will have to wait and see whether the current rumours prove true.

1706,From The Washington Post article A European intelligence official said the British government was examining the video and the speech of the purported executioner to compare it with former Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other British residents believed to have joined the Islamic State. In the video the terrorist who killed Foley spoke in what sounded like a British accent. Sadly that is probably true. Outrage now occurs along party lines and the party that owns the media would not be outraged by this. Indeed
2427,According to a report late Tuesday Apple is on the verge of announcing an acquisition of social network and corresponding app Path possibly in a bid to restart a branded platform after the failure of Ping. As reported by Pando Daily a source with knowledge of the matter claims an agreement between Apple and Path is essentially a done deal. The publication cites one person currently working for Apple in unnamed engineering department. Interestingly the source says Apple is looking to keep Path intact following the rumored buyout a tactic that strays from the companys usual M A tactics. Save for the recent acquisition of Beats Apple usually performs so called acquihires or purchases made for talent not a brand name. The publication speculates that Path may make its way into iOS Messages. Pando Daily also points out that Path cofounder Dave Morin was seen sitting in the front row at Flint Center for Tuesdays iPhone 6 keynote. Apple saves those seats for high ranking executives and special guests. For example during the presentation Jony Ive was seen sitting with design superstar and new Apple employee Marc Newson. Pricing went unmentioned but the struggling social networking firms recent round of funding reportedly clocked in at a sub 400 million valuation much less than a rumored 500 million valuation sought by executives. Further Path is not a high ranking title in the iOS App Store and currently sits below the top 1000 downloaded apps. Aside from being one of the less popular social networking services Path had a few missteps that drew scrutiny from governmental regulatory agencies and even Apple itself. In 2012 the firm was dinged for uploading users address books without permission claiming the automated action was meant to more easily find other friends using the app. The issue snowballed into a US Federal Trade Commission investigation which was ultimately settled for 800000 in early 2013. On the day Paths settlement a researcher discover a flaw in the apps backend that geotagged photos uploaded by users. The problem was quickly patched but shortly thereafter Path was again accused of unacceptable contacts handling techniques. Despite its troubles Path has been featured in the iOS App Store and most recently broke off its in app messaging feature as a standalone app called Path Talk
2195,White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough is denying claims that the administration threatened legal action against the families of kidnapped Americans if they paid ransom to their captors the Islamic State. McDonough hit a series of Sunday interview shows to promote the administrations counterterrorism plan against the Islamic State including a plea to Congress to fund anti Islamic State forces in Syria. The families of James Foley and Steven Sotloff — American journalists beheaded by the Islamic State — said the government objected when they considered ransom payments and even threatened prosecution. We did not threaten anybody but we made clear what the law is McDonough said on Fox News Sunday. that is our responsibility to make sure we explain the law and uphold the law. Ransom payments are prohibited under US law on the theory they would encourage terrorist groups to kidnap more Americans. McDonough said he sympathized with the Foley and Sotloff families and noted that the administration attempted a hostage rescue in Syria. We took every effort — and will continue to take every effort — to secure people he said. In discussing the counter terrorism plan McDonough urged Congress to fund anti Islamic State fighters in Syria and said the US is obviously at war with the militant group. The interviews aired a day after the Islamic State beheaded a third hostage British aid worker David Haines The plan that Obama announced Wednesday includes the prospect of US airstrikes in Syria while expanding ongoing strikes in neighboring Iraq. Obama McDonough and other aides say the plan features assistance to local forces in Iraq and Syria to carry the fight against the Islamic State also known as ISIL or ISIS. In his round of interviews McDonough echoed Obamas pledge to avoid using US combat troops and to rely on forces in Syria and Iraq. that is why the Syrian opposition is so important McDonough said on CNNs State of the Union later adding that it is going to be Iraqi and other boots on the ground that are bringing this fight to ISIL. On ABCs This Week McDonough said that what we want to make sure happens is that we have committed partners who can take the fight to ISIL on the ground. And they will have not only support from us from the air but they will also have training and equipment support from us. Lawmakers and analysts have questioned Obamas plan saying that the United States will have to get more involved — including the prospect of ground troops — if the Islamic State is to be defeated. Sen Lindsey Graham R SC told Fox News Sunday that the Obama administration is delusional about its plan. It is our fight Graham said. it is not just their fight. This is a radical Islamic army that is pushing a theory of a master religion. it is about protecting millions of people throughout the world from a radical Islamic army — they are intending to come here. Graham also said of Obama This president needs to rise to the occasion before we all get killed back here at home. Administration officials have offered different descriptions of the administrationss plan ranging from counter terrorism operations to outright war. On NBCs Meet The Press McDonough said that as much as we have been at war with al Qaeda since we got here we are at war with ISIL. It is a complicated effort McDonough said and success looks like an ISIL that no longer threatens our friends in the region no longer threatens the United States — an ISIL that can not accumulate followers or threaten Muslims in Syria Iran Iraq or otherwise. Secretary of State John Kerry who has disputed the use of the term war told CBS Face The Nation that there is frankly a kind of tortured debate going on about terminology What I am focused on obviously is getting done what we need to get done to ISIL
1504,FERGUSON Mo. This St Louis womans picture and story has spread through social media she is now ready to talk about what happened to her shortly after the grand jury announcement was made in the death of Michael Brown. Dornella Conners is now blind in her left eye and can hardly see out of her right eye after her and her boyfriend DeAngelas Lee stopped at a gas station in the 10000 block of Halls Ferry early Tuesday morning.

918,Mittens the cat has both male and female genitalia. The Canadian kitty who lives with its owner in Hearts Desire Newfoundland will need surgery to cure its bowel and urinary problems as a result of its dual gender CBC reports. Colleen Clarke Murphy took Mittens in when her daughter brought it home thinking it was a stray. In October Mittens was rushed to a vet who gave the surprising news. Clarke Murphy said her first response was Did I just hear you right. Since gender assignment surgery is more a medical need than a cosmetic one the initial question was which gender should Mittens be. Clarke Murphy said she had rather have a female cat but she will follow the veterinarians recommendation to make Mittens a male. they are the ones who know what they are doing. I mean I really do not know. I had like for it to be a female but it really do not matter. it is got both parts she said. I think it is got both personalities so it really do not matter. Mittens will need to be both spayed and neutered before the 1500 reconstructive surgery. Good luck Mittens. Cats with two genders may be uncommon but they are not unheard of Liverpool Echo reports. Late last year a couple in Liverpool was shocked to find that their little white princess Twinkle was also a little white prince. Twinkles vet recommended that the male parts be removed and made it so. The feline is reportedly doing well alongside her brother Socks after her gender assignment surgery. media only screen and ethanmobile display none Like Us On Facebook Follow Us On Twitter Contact The Author

711,BUENOS AIRES Argentina — Argentinas president adopted a Jewish godson under a law intended to counteract an old legend about werewolves. President Christina Fernandez described in seven tweets her meeting with her new godson Yair Tawil a member of a Chabad Lubavitch family. Tawil was adopted under a law passed in the 1920s to counteract a legend that a seventh son born after six boys with no girls in between becomes a werewolf whose bite can turn others into a werewolf. Belief in the legend was once so widespread that families were abandoning giving up for adoption and even killing their own sons. Under the law the boys receive presidential protection a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until their 21st birthday. Until 2009 the law only applied to Catholic boys. Shlomo and Nehama Tawil parents of seven boys in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree and asking for the designation of godson. On Tuesday he became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentinas history. Fernandez received Yair his parents and three of his brothers in her office where they lit Hanukkah candles together. The president in her tweets and photos described to her 34 million Twitter followers a magical moment with a marvelous family. She described Yair as a total sweety and his mother a Queen Esther. She tweeted that the Tawils are a very special family. They have a sort of peace happiness and a lot of love that is not common. The tweet included a link to the presidential blog which includes more photos from the meeting. CORRECTION The original brief stated incorrectly that Shlomo Tawil was the director of the Chabad House in Rosario located in central Argentina. The sentence has been deleted
2568,As genetically modified foods are starting to intrude in our diet concerns have been expressed regarding GM food safety. These concerns as well as the limitations of the procedures followed in the evaluation of their safety are presented. Animal toxicity studies with certain GM foods have shown that they may toxically affect several organs and systems. The review of these studies should not be conducted separately for each GM food but according to the effects exerted on certain organs it may help us create a better picture of the possible health effects on human beings. The results of most studies with GM foods indicate that they may cause some common toxic effects such as hepatic pancreatic renal or reproductive effects and may alter the hematological biochemical and immunologic parameters. However many years of research with animals and clinical trials are required for this assessment. The use of recombinant GH or its expression in animals should be re examined since it has been shown that it increases IGF 1 which may promote cancer
2038,The health focused smartwatch that Apple initially envisioned is not the same one the company will unveil next month according to a new report. Apples original concept for the Apple Watch was one that would track blood pressure heart activity stress levels and other functions the Wall Street Journal reported Monday citing sources familiar with the device. But none of those features will make it into the final product due to a variety of issues according to the Journal. Some features did not work properly. Others proved too complex. And some would have required regulatory approval. As such Apple was forced to scale back the range and depth of health features for its first entry into the smartwatch arena the sources said. Due out in April the Apple Watch will enter an already crowded playing field competing with products from Samsung Sony Motorola Microsoft LG and others. it is been thought that Apple postponed its release of a smartwatch at least in part to perfect the health and fitness monitoring features. But if the Journals sources are correct some of those features proved more challenging than expected. For example the Journal reported Apple tested sensors to measure skin conductivity which would have helped monitor stress levels and heart rate. But the sensors ran into inconsistencies with different people such as those with hairy arms or dry skin and the results were mixed based on how tightly you wore the watch according to the Journals sources. Apple also tested ways to check blood pressure and the level of oxygen in the blood but again the results were inconsistent. Further if those features strayed into the area of actually providing medical advice they would have required approval from the Food and Drug Administration something Apple was trying to avoid. The difficulties in creating a smartwatch with such features prompted people at Apple to dub the project a black hole as it sucked in more and more resources one of the sources said. As a result Apple has been touting its first smartwatch as more of an all purpose wearable. Yes several key health and fitness features will be available and useful especially as third party developers create apps to tap into that market. But Apple is also busy promoting other aspects of the watch including its variety of styles its ability to act as an adjunct to the iPhone its support for Apple Pay and its voice activated controls. Will those features and the Apple name convince enough consumers to consider the Apple Watch over the competition. In December Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster projected unit sales of 8 million for 2015. Wall Street has been forecasting sales of 12 million to 15 million. Apple has reportedly asked its suppliers to manufacture 5 million to 6 million watches for its first quarter of release. Whether initial sales are as healthy as expected Apple will certainly come out with future models. Those could even include some of the health features that did not pass muster the first time around the Journals sources added. An Apple spokeswoman told CNET that the company declined to comment on rumor or speculation
1903,Jasmine Tridevil a massage therapist in Tampa Florida claims that she had a third breast implanted to get famous land a reality show and become unattractive to men because she does not want to date anymore. From CBS Tampa Bay It was really hard finding someone that would do it because they are breaking the code of ethics she said. The third breast was constructed in the middle of her chest with a silicone implant and skin tissue that was cut from her abdomen. She signed a non disclosure agreement with the doctor who performed the surgery. Although the surgeon was unable to make an artificial areola Tridevil says she fixed that by having it made in a tattoo. Tridevil said she was filmed when she told her parents about the surgery in hopes that the video will be featured on her own reality show. She says she personally hired the camera crew to film her after more than two years of saving money. My mum ran out the door. She will not talk to me. She will not let my sister talk to me. My dad … he really is not happy … he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it she said. My dad is still there for me. Here is Jasmine Tridevils Twitter. Heres a Real Radio 1041 interview

1770,Apparently Las Vegas is not the only city on the National Hockey Leagues expansion team radar Seattle Toronto and Quebec City will add franchises as well with a target date of 2017 according to a tweet from SportsBusinessNews Howard Bloom. Bloom said the four fold expansion which would increase the number of NHL teams to 34 and the number of Canadian team to nine could raise 14 billion in expansion fees. A report Tuesday in Canadas The Province revealed the finalization of an NHL franchise in Las Vegas with only the new teams ownership left to determine. The move would entitle Las Vegas to a professional sports franchise in one of the four major sports leagues for the first time in the citys history. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has previously voiced disapproval of such a move out of concern over the citys potentially damaging connection to the sports betting industry. On Wednesday morning Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly publicly denied that anything was imminent in Las Vegas. Seattle has been at the center of expansion rumors for more than a year and Quebec City has a new arena that is slated to open in 2015. A new team in Toronto would mean a second franchise for the city. The Maple Leafs are the NHLs highest grossing and most valuable franchise by net worth. Will Green
1389,A sickly stray cat that was taken in by a family in Canada is set to undergo gender reassignment surgery. Mittens was adopted by Colleen Clarke Murphy and her family who live in Hearts Desire Newfoundland and when they took the cat to a veterinarian in October they for quite the surprise when they found out the cat was a hermaphrodite. And since Clarke Murphy already had a male cat and Mittens has both genitalia she decided she wanted a female cat. Scroll down for video Mittens will be the first cat to undergo gender reassignment surgery The cat is a hermaphrodite with both genitalia and while new owner Colleen Clarke Murphy was hoping for a girl they advised it would be best for Mittens to become a boy Did I just hear you right. asked Clarke Murphy to the vet after she was told the news. She got another surprise soon after when she learned the female cat she wanted was not in the animals best interest according to her vet and they would make the cat male. they are the ones who know what they are doing Clarke Murphy told CBC News. I mean I really do not know. I had like for it to be a female but it really do not matter. it is got both parts. I think it is got both personalities so it really do not matter. So then it was decided the cat would be spayed neutered and have reconstructive surgery. The cost. 1500. Money is not an object to Clarke Murphy however when it comes to Mittens. Mittens will now be spayed and neutered and then have reconstructive surgery She was part of my family when she came home with my daughter she said. what is more there are problems that come with the cats current situation as it has bowel issues and problems urinating. Now a friend of Clarke Murphy is auctioning off some items on Facebook to help pay the vet bill
163,In a day packed with major Apple announcements the company tackled smartphones wearables and payments. But there is one more sector that may be about to get the Apple treatment Social. According to a single well placed source inside Apples engineering team the company is poised to announce an acquisition of Dave Morins Path social network. To quote our source who requested to remain anonymous because the deal has not been announced yet it is almost done if not signed already but it is essentially a done deal. If true it would be major news for the heretofore struggling social platform that has been known more for its design and user interface innovations than for its ability to drive adoption among consumers – particularly in non Asian markets. Apple has not fared much better in the social realm historically having flopped with its Ping social network and having made very little out of its acquisition of the team and IP from failed location based photo social network Color. According to our source this is more than just a talent acquisition or acquihire. The Path product will likely survive the acquisition and be incorporated in whole or in part into Apples newly refreshed Messages app. That does not mean that the deal will be priced like some other recent high profile mobile communication deals namely Facebooks 19 billion Whatsapp acquisition and rumored 3 billion plus offers extended to Snapchat by Facebook and Google. Facebook paid 42 per Whatsapp user and 33 per Instagram user before that. By comparison Rakuten bought the far less beloved Viber for just 3 per user. With Path having somewhere in the vicinity of 25 million users at the beginning of this year and far weaker growth and engagement than any of the above platforms it would be lucky to command anywhere near InstagramWhatsapp sums. According to App Annie Path ranks just 177th among iOS Social Networking apps in the US and not among the top 1000 overall iOS apps. When Path raised its most recent round in January of this year the company reportedly commanded a sub 400 million valuation well below the 500 million plus levels reportedly sought by management. Given the trajectory it was on exiting at that level would likely be considered a win among most Path insiders. Hell for many Valley observers that would be the win of the century for Path investors many of which have all but left the company for dead. Apples re entry into social would also be a notable development. With Facebook Twitter and Snapchat each looking stronger than ever in their respective social verticals it is unclear just where an Apple driven social product would fit in among consumers daily habits. Google seems to have reached a similar conclusion all but abandoning its strategy of pushing Google as a standalone social platform and instead choosing to let the platform fade into the background of its other consumers platforms like Gmail and YouTube. Apples one stronghold has been in messaging via iMessage which recently got a facelift. And Path has recently leaned more in this direction with its launch of an ephemeral messaging product abandoning its long held love of more lasting intimate communications. it is certainly conceivable that Path could be integrated into Apples messaging platform but it is unclear beyond the design prowess how this acquisition helps Apple at any price. Adding additional fuel to this fire Dave Morin was spotted sitting in the front row for todays Apple keynote event a high profile position reserved for Dr Dre and other key Apple insiders. Did not forget about Dre. pictwittercomfWNDpFhfYr — Dave Morin September 9 2014 Apple has been known to be a fan of Morins as well as the Path design aesthetic and broader design team. Take for example the companys decision to feature the Path app early on in numerous keynotes and advertising campaigns. In that sense it would not be that surprising if such a deal were to be consummated. Jason Calacanis made a similar observation in his evening email newsletter today noting Morins seating at todays event and Apples long standing frustrations around social. Others have been asking whether such an acquisition makes sense for years. To be clear even if our source is correct these transactions are never a sure thing until ink has been put to paper and a public announcement has been made. But the tea leaves seem to be aligning on this deal. it is certainly an unexpected outcome but it would sound even more crazy if Apple did not have north of 150 billion in cash burning a hole in its pocket and a love for all things aesthetic. And with Morins vaunted reputation for design and Apples social struggles I can not think of a better home for the once hyped app. do not be surprised to see Apple swoop in to rescue Path from social also ran status. Pando has reached out to Morin for confirmation of the claim. We will update this post as soon as I hear back
1792,While Apples iPhone 6 has only been out in the market for four months there are already rumors regarding the upcoming iPhone 6S. The iPhone 6S will not be released until over half a year from now but rumors out of Taiwan are suggesting that Apple is considering a dual lens system for the smartphones camera according to website UDN citing sources from Apples supply chain in Asia. In addition Force Touch the pressure sensitive touch system technology which will be launched with the release of the Apple Watch could also be included in the iPhone 6S. The transition into a dual lens system for the iPhone 6Ss camera will allow Apple to include an optical zoom feature on their flagship smartphone for the first time. The camera module of the iPhone 6S which will likely undergo a redesign will also lead to improvements in the low light photo capture performance for the smartphone by allowing additional light to enter the cameras sensor. Apple has been making sizeable investments in the companys imaging technology counting the camera of the iPhone as one of its most marketable assets. As such the camera of the iPhone is a possible area of interest for upgrades to be made in the future. The camera sensor in the iPhone 6 Plus which was supplied to Apple by Sony includes features such as optical image stabilization and phase detection autofocus. As such the camera of the iPhone 6 Plus has received praise from experts as the best smartphone camera ever made rivaling even the quality of many current models of point and shoot cameras. In addition to the rumors regarding the camera of the iPhone 6S TPK a touch module supplier based in Taiwan is said to be a possible supplier of three dimensional touch sensors for the smartphone. These sensors will bring Force Touch technology to the iPhone 6S a feature that will be introduced in the upcoming wearable device Apple Watch. For the Apple Watch Force Touch will allow the device to detect the amount of pressure applied by the user in touch commands which will then translate to different input commands. For example users pressing heavily on the devices screen can bring up a list of options and a light press on the screen can then select one of those options. Such a feature could prove to be useful in the iPhone 6S. UDN also thinks that the feature will be included in the smartphone to lead to higher accuracy in the reading of the pulse and blood pressure of the user as an additional input sensor for Apples HealthKit system
1038,The terrorist group is reportedly demanding one million dollars to deliver the journalists body across the Syrian border to Turkey The Islamic State is trying to sell the the remains of beheaded hostage James Foley to his parents for 1million it has been claimed. With the terrorist group failing to strike ransom deals it is now trying to negotiate the sales of at least one of the men it has killed. Sources with ties to ISIS or its associates told BuzzFeed News that it wants to sell the remains of the US journalist whose death was the first in a series of high profile executions. They said that for 1 million around £638000 the group would deliver Mr Foleys body across the border to Turkey and would provide a DNA sample to facilitate a deal. All three of the sources seeking to act as middlemen in a deal with the secretive extremists have been granted anonymity to protect their safety. VIEW GALLERY One of the three sources seeking to act as middlemen a former Syrian rebel fighter said he was approached by an ISIS leader who asked him to find a channel to either the US government or Foleys family. He said They ask for 1 million and they will send DNA to Turkey but they want the money first he said. They will not give the DNA without the money. He claimed his motivation was to help the grieving family find closure calling his work a humanity case. Another intermediary a businessman who has sought to use his own ISIS connections to facilitate hostage deals in the past was candid about his goals saying This is business. The Foley family had no comment for the the websites article. An official with the US State Department said we are seeking more information on whether ISIS is trying to sell the remains of US hostages. While a senior American diplomat reportedly called the idea disgusting
2073,A 42 year old Russian fisherman was being mauled by a brown bear when his Justin Bieber Baby ringtone saved his life he believes. The Daily Mail reports that Igor Vorozhbitsyn had parked his car and was walking towards his favorite fishing spot when the bear attacked him and began clawing his face and chest but then his phone rang playing the annoying crescendo of baby baby baby baby oooh and the bear did what any creature with ears would do when it heard Justin Bieber it fled. I could not believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled he said. The man who sustained cuts and bruises on his face and chest and was taken to the hospital after other fisherman found him said he firmly believes if his phone had not rang he would have been killed marking the first time in written history that someone has been thankful for Justin Biebers existence
102,People with ties to Islamic State are reportedly trying to negotiate the sale of American hostage James Foleys remains according to BuzzFeed News. ISIS is reportedly attempting to sell the body and deliver it across the Syrian border to Turkey sources in contact with the terror group told Mike Giglio at BuzzFeed. One source told BuzzFeed that an ISIS leader approached him about the sale of Foleys body and asked if he could get in contact with someone within the US government or Foleys family. ISIS executed Foley on camera and posted the video online in August. He was captured in northwest Syria on Thanksgiving Day 2012. The terror group makes millions of dollars from its hostages. They typically demand ransoms from the countries the hostages are from but some countries like the US refuse to pay up. Selling Foleys remains seems to be a way for ISIS to make money off of him in lieu of a ransom. Since Foleys death ISIS has executed three other Western hostages — US journalist Steven Sotloff British aid worker Alan Henning and US aid worker Peter Kassig. The executions seem to be retaliation for airstrikes in the Middle East. SEE ALSO 3 Big Sources Of Revenue Help ISIS Make Millions Each Day
332,NEW YORK — Hewlett Packard is splitting itself into two companies one focused on its personal computer and printing business and another on technology services such as data storage servers and software as it aims to drive profits higher. The company laid off tens of thousands of people in recent years as sales crumbled with customers shifting to mobile devices like smartphones and computer tablets. That has drastically curbed demand for HPs desktop and laptop computers as well as its printers. The company said Monday that the PC and printer business will use the name HP Inc. The services business will be called Hewlett Packard Enterprise. FILE In this Aug 21 2012 file photo the Hewlett Packard Co logo is seen outside the companys headquarters in Palo Alto Calif Hewlett Packard Co is splitting itself into two companies one focused on its personal computer and printing business and another on technology services such as data storage servers and software as it aims to drive stronger profitability. HP CEO Meg Whitman will lead the Enterprise business. HP PC and printer chief Dion Weisler will be CEO of HP Inc The decision to separate into two market leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan Whitman said. It will provide each new company with the independence focus financial resources and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics. The split if approved by the company board is expected to close by the end of fiscal 2015. Once complete HP stockholders will own shares of both companies. During its most recent quarter HP reported revenue of 276 billion a 1 percent annual gain. It marked HPs first year over year increase in quarterly revenue since late 2011. Printers and computers contributed 51 percent of the companys quarterly revenue with the rest coming from technology services like consulting software and financial programs. HP is expected to complete the latest round of layoffs between 11000 to 16000 people this month. That is on top of the 34000 people it had already jettisoned from its payroll. Another tech stalwart announced a split this month. In a bid to drive growth eBay Inc said it would spin off its mobile payment service PayPal into a separate and publicly traded company. Investors sent eBay shares up more than 7 percent on the day of the announcement. HP maintained its guidance for fiscal 2014 adjusted earnings between 370 and 374 per share. Analysts polled by FactSet predict earnings of 373 per share. For fiscal 2015 the company anticipates adjusted earnings in a range of 383 to 403 per share. Wall Street is looking for 396 per share. Shares of Hewlett Packard Co based in Palo Alto California gained 285 or 81 percent to 3805 before the market open. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article
2493,A Russian man was recently able to fend off a bear attack with a Justin Bieber song. Forty two year old Igor Vorozhbitsyn was recently fishing in Russias Yakutia Republic when he was attacked by a bear. During the ordeal Vorozhbitsyns phone which has Biebers Baby as the ringtone went off causing the startled bear to run away. While some might argue the pop song has the ability to repel animals wildlife experts say the bears might not have anything against Justin Bieber per se. The volume of the ringtone is probably what stopped the attack. One expert told Central European News that an unexpected noise like a ringtone can stop an angry bear in its tracks
233,Never has the saying hell hath no fury like a woman scorned been more fitting than when a jilted wife in China chopped off her cheating husbands penis twice. When Feng Lung 30 discovered her husband was having an affair she cut off his manhood with a pair of scissors then snipped it off again after surgeons reattached it. She is now facing jail after being arrested for causing grievous bodily harm. Fan Lung turned on his wife after she cut off his penis for a second time and he was spotted naked and bloody attacking her outside the hospital Two timing dad of five Fan Lung 32 had used his wifes mobile to send lover Zhang Hung 21 a saucy email from his marital home in the city of Shangqiu in central Chinas Henan province. But after forgetting to log out of his account stunned wife Feng came across the message and several others and flew into a rage. Grabbing a pair of scissors she stormed into their bedroom where he was sleeping and cut off his penis. Surgeons were able to reattach it but fuming Feng sneaked into his hospital room and cut it off again before throwing it out of a window. This prompted the cheat to turn on his wife and he was spotted naked and bloody attacking her outside the hospital. A hospital spokesman said The first we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital. Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman. He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again. Lover Zhang Hung visited Fan in hospital and said she planned to marry him as soon as she could Doctors and police officers combed the area outside but failed to find the mans missing member. They believe it may have been taken by a stray dog or cat. The hospital spokesman said The man had lost a lot of blood and was taken in for emergency surgery. He is now in a stable condition but is extremely emotionally distraught. Fans lover who visited him at the hospital said she planned to marry him as soon as she could. It does not matter that he is lost his fertility he has five children already Zhang said. Feng was discharged and is now under arrest for grievous bodily harm
2258,It was with a healthy dose of scepticism that we brought you reports of a 21 year old woman who allegedly had surgery to obtain a third breast. The massage therapist from Tampa Florida claimed to have paid 20000 for the procedure in an attempt to secure herself a reality show on MTV. Using an obvious pseudonym Jasmine Tridevil told an American radio station she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found a surgeon willing to operate. Jasmine Tridevil says she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery She claims the one who did agree forced her to sign a non disclosure agreement in order to protect his anonymity because he was breaking the code of ethics. Tridevils dubious story is not helped by the fact that all the available images of her appear to have been taken by herself with no third parties present and that the footage she has posted is decidedly grainy. And now the internet sleuths of Snopes have weighed in with some pretty convincing research that indicates Tridevil may be playing the media. It points out The JASMINETRIDEVILCOM domain was registered by someone named Alisha Hessler and Jasmine Tridevil herself bears a striking likeness to Tampa area massage therapist Alisha Jasmine Hessler. Photos on a modeling page linked with Hessler closely matched the circulating images of Jasmine Tridevil and profile pictures on Hesslers YouTube page strongly resembled the woman in the third breast photos. Snopes also claims an Alisha Jasmine Hessler was taken into custody in Florida last year and charged with fraudulent use of personal information and that a woman with the same name has had previous brushes with viral fame. However Tridevil continues to insist she and her three breasts are the real deal. She told The Sun This is not a fake. I had a procedure done. If people do not believe it that is up to them. Tridevil dreams of starring in her own reality TV show She also claims her self financed film crew recorded footage of her operation adding I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I do not really care what people think or say about me. I know what I have done. As I say this is not a fake or a hoax. Speaking exclusively to 10 News Tampa Tridevil obliged the channel with a quick flash of her third breast but when asked why she would not allow a closer look replied with I am not ready to do that right now because it is in episode six of my show. Meanwhile Jezebel spoke to an attending plastic surgeon at Cedars Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles. Looks familiar A three breasted woman makes an appearance in 1990s Total Recall Kaitlyn Leeb reprised the role in the 2012 remake of the film Dr Mossi Salibian a member of the hospitals multidisciplinary breast expert team said such a procedure would be possible but mercifully added he did not believe any doctor would perform such an operation. He said There are many things that are possible but that does not mean we would do it. Over to you dear readers
898,The woman was reportedly furious she had not been told of his condition An Indian bride has reportedly swapped her groom for a wedding guest mid ceremony after her fiancé had an epileptic seizure. Jugal Kishore 25 reportedly fell to the ground during the traditional exchange of varmala flower garlands in the northern town of Rampur. His illness was a shock to his wife to be 23 year old Indira who was apparently furious that she and her family had not been told of Mr Kishores epilepsy. Instead of calling the wedding off she quickly chose wedding guest Harpal Singh her sisters brother in law to replace him. Casually dressed in jeans and a leather jacket he accepted the Times of India reported. After the swap the wedding ceremony continued as planned until Mr Kishore returned from hospital. Shocked at returning to his own wedding to find his fiancée celebrating her marriage to someone else he and his relatives reportedly pleaded with Indira to reverse her decision. When diplomacy failed the family allegedly resorted to violence and entered into a brawl involving plates and cutlery. Mr Kishores family later filed a complaint at the local Milak police station but withdrew it after older relatives intervened. RP Solanki an official at the station told the Times of India two wedding guests were briefly arrested. Both families have amicably resolved the matter he added. The complaints have been withdrawn. Kishore and his family have now returned in peace to Moradabad
2126,An Afghan woman has killed at least 25 Taliban militants to avenge the murder of her son who was a police officer in western Farah province. According to reports Reza Gul was forced to pick up arms after her son was shot dead by Taliban militants in front of her eyes. Her son was leading a small group of police forces in a check post located in a village of Farah province. She was supported by her daughter and daughter in law during the gun battle which lasted for almost 7 hours that left at least 25 Taliban militants dead and five others injured. Sediq Sediq spokesman for the Ministry of Interior said the armed campaign by women against the Taliban militants is a symbol of a major revolution and public uprising against the group. The Taliban militants group has not commented regarding the incident so far. Farah is among the volatile provinces in western Afghanistan where anti government armed militants are actively operating in its various districts and frequently carry out insurgency activities
2486,Tridevil who hopes to land a show on MTV says a film crew recorded her 20000 procedure adding a breast to her body. This is not fake she insisted. But a police report shows she once lost a 3 breast prosthesis in stolen luggage. She apparently took everyone for a boob. A 21 year old Florida woman who claimed she had plastic surgery to place a third boob on her rack claims said she is no hoaxer. But an incident report filed with the Tampa International Airport Police Department shows that she was carrying a 3 breast prosthesis in luggage stolen from her in early September. This is not a fake Jasmine Tridevil told the Sun in an interview posted Tuesday. I had the procedure done. If people do not believe it that is up to them. The publicity hungry Tridevil who hopes to land a show on MTV told the British newspaper that a film crew recorded her 20000 procedure. The massage therapist claims to have seen at least 50 doctors before finding one who would perform the procedure. I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I do not really care what people think or say about me she told the Sun. I know what I have done. As I say this is not a fake or a hoax. Since Tridevil has failed to provide any real proof many are skeptical about her wild claim straight out of the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger cult favorite Total Recall. She did give a Tampa TV station a quick flash but would not show more because I am not ready to do that right now because it is in episode six of my show. She may not have helped her cause with a bizarre interview with an Orlando radio station last week. Well I am crazy she told the The News Junkie show. Crazy people do not know they are crazy so technically since I know I am crazy I am not crazy. Police said the three boob device was spotted after Tridevils luggage was stolen off an American Airlines conveyor belt. When cops caught the suspects after identifying them on surveillance footage investigators listed the prosthesis with Tridevils belongings before they were returned. Tridevil also appears to have a questionable past. In March 2013 when she was calling herself Alisha Hessler she was busted for identity theft for using a fake ID at a Florida bar. She stated I got it off of Craigslist for 20 read the police report obtained by the Daily News. I asked her if she knew the female on the identification and she replied no not at all. And in December Hessler was lectured by cops after she shamed Florida man Gabriel Urena into standing in the street with a sign reading I beat women. Honk if I am a scumbag after he allegedly groped and beat her. She also forced Urena to wear a dunce cap but in return she dropped the charges ABC Action News reported. dboroff nydailynewscom
1039,The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has beheaded Steven Joel Sotloff the second American executed by the Islamic militant group and posted a video of it on the Internet the SITE Intelligence Group a research organization that tracks jihadist web postings said Tuesday. The execution of Mr Sotloff 31 came despite pleas from his mother aimed directly at ISISs top leader seeking mercy for her son a freelance journalist who was captured in northern Syria a year ago. Word of Mr Sotloffs beheading came two weeks after James Foley 45 another American journalist was beheaded by ISIS which warned that Mr Sotloff would be the next to die. In the latest video Mr Sotloff describes himself as paying the price for the Obama administrations decision to strike ISIS targets in Iraq. The same masked fighter who appeared in the video of Mr Foleys beheading also appears beside Mr Sotloff asserting I am back Obama and I am back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State. The SITE group also said ISIS was threatening a third captive a Briton it identified David Cawthorne Haines as the next beheading victim. At least two other Americans are believed to be held by ISIS
2551,Many people with chronic health problems resign themselves to lives of modest activity or no activity at all thinking vigorous exercise is unsafe or that they lack the stamina for it. But recent studies are proving just the opposite. They are showing that high intensity exercise may be even better than regular aerobic activities for many patients with conditions like heart disease diabetes stroke pulmonary disease arthritis and Parkinsons disease. The studies strongly suggest that a more demanding but more efficient and often more enjoyable form of exercise known as high intensity interval training or HIIT is not only safe for most patients but more effective at preventing or reversing the deficits associated with many chronic ailments. Although once reserved for athletes seeking a competitive advantage and for healthy people wanting to burn more body fat HIIT is now being studied as a treatment that is sometimes as effective as medication for many people with chronic health problems. Researchers have found that repeatedly pushing the body close to its exercise limits for very brief periods interspersed with periods of rest is more effective than continuous moderate activity at improving cardiovascular respiratory metabolic and mechanical functions. Instead of continuous movement for 20 or more minutes as is typical for exercise walkers joggers and cyclists HIIT usually involves 30 to 60 seconds of exercise near the peak of a persons ability followed by a comparable recovery period of easy activity with the sequence repeated for a total of about 20 minutes three times a week. We know that exercise is good for people at risk of chronic disease but people tend not to exercise said Jonathan P Little a specialist in exercise physiology at the University of British Columbia at Okanagan. Yet he and other researchers report that study participants find interval training more enjoyable than continuous aerobic exercise making it more likely that people will continue it on their own. Various activities can be adapted to interval training including cycling swimming walking and jogging especially on a machine like a stationary bike or treadmill. But HIIT is possible indoors and out for example by alternating sprints with more moderate exercise. The intensity is tailored to an individuals starting ability. The high intensity component is set at 80 to 90 percent of the persons maximum aerobic capacity Dr Little said. Researchers commonly use exercise bikes and treadmills to adjust the pace mechanically. However high intensity exercise even just half a minute at a time is not appropriate for everyone. In a recent report in the American College of Sports Medicines Health Fitness Journal Dr Little his wife Mary E Jung also at the University of British Columbia and Marcus W Kilpatrick of the University of South Florida wrote that HIIT is only appropriate for low risk individuals moderate risk individuals who have been cleared for vigorous intensities by a medical professional and high risk individuals who are under direct medical supervision during exercise training. Among the physiological benefits of HIIT are the bodys increased ability to use oxygen and insulin as well as arteries that are more elastic than continuous moderate exercise can achieve. we have seen for example that interval training is remarkably effective at lowering glucose levels in people with diabetes Dr Little said in an interview. Just one session improves a persons glucose level. A 12 week controlled study in Denmark of high intensity interval walking for patients with Type 2 diabetes showed it helped control blood glucose levels better than continuous moderate exercise even though the same number of calories was expended by both groups. Interval training also was more effective at enhancing the patients physical fitness and reducing body fat relative to lean muscle tissue. By making blood vessels better able to expand HIIT can improve the cardiovascular systems ability to respond to added exertion. Oxygen carrying blood can flow more smoothly through arteries that are wide open which also reduces the risk of a vessel blocking clot. The bodys ability to use oxygen efficiently improves markedly after as little as two weeks of training with HIIT the researchers wrote. Peak oxygen uptake — the amount of oxygen an individual can use during intense exercise — is considered the best indicator of cardiovascular fitness and an independent predictor of illness and death in cardiac patients. Too many people think incorrectly that high intensity exercise is only for athletes that it is a heart attack waiting to happen Dr Little said. On the contrary the research strongly suggests it is more likely to reduce the risk of a heart attack. In a 2012 report reviewing the effects of HIIT in patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure researchers in Canada France and Switzerland wrote that HIIT appears safe and better tolerated by patients than moderate intensity continuous exercise and more effective at increasing patients peak oxygen uptake blood vessel flexibility and pumping ability of the heart. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are often unable to exercise long enough to gain needed health benefits. But they can do HIIT for long periods with less shortness of breath and leg discomfort researchers at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens have reported. Stroke patients with persistent disabilities can also benefit from HIIT. As rehabilitation specialists at the University of Cincinnati wrote this month in BioPortfolio stroke patients with residual weakness enter a vicious cycle of limited activity and deconditioning. But while regular aerobic exercise can improve their function and cardiovascular health preliminary studies including one in Trondheim Norway suggest that patients do even better with HIIT. The Norwegian team reported that the improvements persisted for months after the six week high intensity exercise program ended. And Polish researchers demonstrated that HIIT could alleviate the rigidity and excessive muscle tone that makes it difficult for Parkinsons disease patients to move their arms and legs. The researchers from the University School of Physical Education in Krakow Poland showed in 11 patients with mild to moderate Parkinsons symptoms that eight weeks of HIIT three times a week on a stationary bike had a global benefit improving both lower and upper body function. Reductions in rigidity and stiffness correlated with an increase in a substance called brain derived neurotrophic factor which the researchers suggested could have stimulated the growth and function of nerves normally influenced by dopamine the neurotransmitter that declines in Parkinsons disease
2312,The three Afghanistan National Army officers who disappeared this weekend during a training exercise on Cape Cod have been found trying to cross the border into Canada near Niagara Falls sources said Monday. A top Massachusetts law enforcement officials tells NBC News that the three were caught at the famed Rainbow Bridge. The three arrived 11 days ago with 200 soldiers and civilians from several countries for training at Camp Edwards on Joint Base Cape Cod. They were last seen Saturday at a shopping mall in Hyannis during a day off. Massachusetts State Police with the help of the FBI and the Guard had been trying to find them. Col Timothy Alben superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police had told NBC News earlier there is no reason to think they have nefarious intent and no information to suggest that public safety is in question. But there is a pause for concern because we want to make sure this was not planned and we want to see if anyone has helped them. He said because the men have visas that remain valid for the next several days they are in the country legally. Several officials say the widely held view is that they were trying to find some way to stay in the country. Gov. Deval Patrick today said publicly what many state and local officials say privately — that they are not considered a danger. Their disappearance follows an apparently similar event last week when two policemen from Afghanistan went missing during a DEA training program in the Washington area. They were found in New York. Earlier this month a senior Afghan military officer slated to carry the flag for his country at a NATO summit in Wales applied for asylum in the United Kingdom upon his arrival
746,You will not believe this one. According to Buzzfeed a young woman from Tampa Fla has become the latest viral sensation by claiming she had plastic surgery to get a third breast. She even claims her strange look has landed her appearances on Inside Edition and Jimmy Kimmel Live. But so far at least that part of her story is not panning out. The woman who goes by the name Jasmine Tridevil wrote on Facebook So I am flying to New York to appear on The Inside Edition show this Monday. Then going to be on the news Jimmy Kimmel show and Vice magazine. oh and a few radio shows. FOX411 talked to Inside Edition and they told us they are not interviewing her. And she is not on the schedule that gets sent out with Kimmel guests either. But Kimmel is famous for online pranks including a viral video called Worst twerk fail EVER purportedly of a hilarious twerking accident that turned out to be staged by his show. HEALTH Purported third breast add raises medical ethical questions In trying to further track down the story we did find Tridevils real name and cell phone number and we gave her a call but so far have not received a reply to our voice mail message. Which is a shame because we have several questions to ask about her unique tale. Tridevil said in a recent radio interview that she got the surgery a few months ago and had a very hard time finding a doctor who would agree to her request. They did have an issue with it and it was really hard finding somebody that would do it too because they are breaking the code of ethics to do it she said. I called 50 or 60 doctors and no one would do it. She says when she eventually found a doctor who agreed to do her surgery she had to sign a confidentiality agreement stating she would not reveal his identity. She said paid 20000 for the purported surgery. Tridevil also says she is currently filming her own reality show that she hopes will land on MTV. Well she would most likely have a role if they ever decided to do another Total Recall remake. WATCH Four4Four Duke porn star next on Vogue cover
1391,The Islamic State of Syria and Iraq has reportedly released a video showing the beheading of Steven Joel Sotloff a US journalist being held by the group. The New York Times Reuters and the Washington Post cited a report from the SITE Intelligence Group on the video that purportedly showed Sotloffs killing. Sotloff who has reported for Time magazine and Foreign Policy has been missing since August 2013. In the video that showed the murder of American journalist James Foley an ISIS militant brought Sotloff in front of the camera and threatened his life. The news broke moments before the daily White House press briefing began. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said he was not in a position to confirm the authenticity of the video or the reports. Our thoughts and prayers first and foremost are with his family and those who worked with him Earnest said. This post has been updated
2586,Remember how much Republicans wanted to repeal Obamacare. The Republican majority in the House of Representatives has voted more than 50 times to repeal the law. Conservatives have twice brought challenges to the Supreme Court — a court with powerful voices that often lean in their direction — only to be largely rebuffed both times. The last government shutdown was driven by Republicans who insisted on defunding Obamacare. Some suggest that the calls for repealing Obamacare are fading. Sarah Kliff argued that the near complete absence of Obamas health overhaul in last weeks Republican presidential debate was remarkable. Maybe but do not count on it. In GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bushs white paper on how he would get to 4 percent growth through supply side tax cuts his team of economists stresses that repealing the Affordable Care Act will be an important means of enhancing economic growth. Front runner Donald Trump said just last week that he was going to replace Obamacare with DonaldCare which would be both absolutely great and really spectacular. Repealing health care reform remains a prominent talking point for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Sen Ted Cruz both GOP presidential candidates. Well since we do not know what is in it I can not comment on DonaldCare. But I can tell you this about Obamacare When it comes to meeting one of its most important goals — providing coverage to the uninsured — it is working extremely well. it is posting historical gains on this front and in so doing both insulating itself from repeal and creating a daunting political challenge for its opponents. The facts of the case are thoroughly drawn out in this new analysis by my colleagues Matt Broaddus and Edwin Park from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities — As the figure above shows newly released census data show that the share of those without health coverage fell from 133 percent to 104 last year. — that is the largest single year drop on record based on data going back to 1987 hi2 Source B P — In this type of work the strength of your findings are much bolstered when you see them across multiple sources. As B P point out the census findings are consistent with the historic coverage gains measured in the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions National Health Interview Survey and several private surveys…at 92 percent the CDCs estimated uninsured rate for the first quarter of 2015 was the lowest since the CDC began collecting these data in 1997 and more than 40 percent below the peak in 2010. — The ACA takes a two pronged attack on covering the uninsured subsidizing private coverage through the exchanges and expanding Medicaid in the 25 states that accepted that part of the deal. Both private and public coverage are making significant gains. — Speaking of anti Obamacare ideology and its effect on people B P provide this revealing calculation If the uninsured rate had fallen in non expansion states at the same rate as in expansion states an additional 26 million uninsured Americans would have gained coverage last year. — Coverage last year grew most quickly among households with income below 50000 their uninsured rate fell from about 20 percent to about 15 percent — in one year. Households above 50000 had lower uninsured rates to start with so we would expect smaller changes but they too went from 9 percent to 74 percent. Such truths are more than inconvenient for sworn enemies of the law. They can bob and weave in their primaries but once they reach the general election their Democratic opponent will slam them on these points. And unless they are willing to massively flip — pretty unimaginable given the heat generated by the issue for conservatives — people represented in the numbers and charts above will rightfully fear that their health security is at stake. I can not overemphasize the importance of these facts and yes I know better than most that our political discourse too often exists in a fact free zone. But the success of the ACA strikes at the heart of the dysfunction strategy employed extremely effectively by anti government conservatives. This is the self fulfilling prophecy strategy that campaigns on Washington is broken. Send me there and I will make sure it stays that way. Remember when government messes up when it shuts down when it fails to address the things that matter to most people — economic opportunity wage stagnation affordable college — and instead squabbles about Planned Parenthood the winners are those who can say See. We told you. Governments broken. Never mind that those making that case are the ones doing the breaking. But with Obamacare they have been failing and the more we elevate that case the closer we get to the road back to Factville

1762,UPDATE Nothing to see here move along ARABIAN SECURITY SOURCE SAYS FIRE OCCURRED IN AN OIL PIPELINE NOT TERRORIST ATTACK. FIRE BROKE OUT DURING REPAIERS NOW UNDER CONTROL It appears Saudi markets are back in play. As Bloombergs Richard Breslow noted this morning Riyal forwards have jerked notably higher and the Tadawul All Share Index has dropped 7 in the last 2 days after the killing of Shiites by unknown parties and now news that a pipeline has exploded. As Breslow warns if that indeed signifies the spread of Islamic State into Saudi Arabia it would be the first time they crossed Saudi borders. That would be a big deal and a major escalation of problems over in that part of the world far beyond what it would do to capital markets. Yesterday there were attacks on Shiites Saudi security forces on Tuesday shot dead a member of an armed group that killed five people in an overnight attack on Shiite Muslims marking an important religious anniversary al Arabiya television reported. The late Monday assault on a Shiite gathering in al Ahsa district is likely to test already strained relations between Sunnis and Shiites across the Middle East because it coincided with the annual Ashoura commemoration of Shiite Islam. The Dubai based al Arabiya said security forces who had been hunting suspects in the al Ahsa attack clashed with and killed a wanted man at a rest area in the al Qassim province north west of the capital Riyadh. and today what is allegedly an Aramco pipeline just exploded near the town of Sudair south of Riyadh. The Region Has sent stocks and the currency reeling. And sparked a 2 surge in WTI crude It would appear the Saudis might need US protection after all how convenient as they continue their attacks on the US Shale industry. As OilPro adds two other discussions are going around trading desks This is a way to get oil prices to go back up without the Saudis appearing to give in and defend price by voluntarily cutting supply. A pipeline explosion will automatically decrease production. The US Elections are over time for prices at the pump to go back up now. This plays on the long tenured theory that gasoline prices tend to be lowest right before elections as the incumbent party leverages their power to please the masses
1601,A Polish teenager allegedly woke up during a surgical operation on her brain and asked the doctors a simple question How is the surgery going. Iga Jasica 19 was receiving treatment at Central Clinical Hospital in Katowice Poland for a cancerous growth on her brain. According to the Mirror Jasica awoke during the surgery after the anesthetic she had been administered wore off. Jasicas brain was exposed as she verbally communicated with the doctors asking them how the surgery was going. Her tone was apparently casual and she was not disturbed by waking up during the procedure. Despite coming round she did not feel anything and was never in danger said Neurosurgeon Professor Dawid Larysz who explained that the girl could not see or feel anything during the operation. Jasica remained optimistic about her experience in the operating room mostly acknowledging her gratitude that the surgery was successful. I can not remember much but the doctor said he talked to me about cats which I love. I missed Christmas because of this operation but it is the best present I could have had as I am now feeling great Jasica said. According to Fox News doctors at the hospital are investigating whether or not the anesthetic was improperly administered prior to Jessicas operation. Source The Mirror Fox News Photo Credit Fox News

435,The jihadist group the Islamic State is trying to sell the body of US journalist James Foley for a reported 1 million. The extremist terrorist organization executed Foley in a gruesome beheading video in August. Two more US citizens — American Israeli journalist Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig — have followed as well as two UK nationals David Haine and Alan Henning both aid workers as well. Foleys was the first in a series of the grisly publicized executions that shocked many in the West. British journalist John Cantile and an unnamed 26 year old American woman remain in IS captivity. IS offered to provide a DNA sample and transfer Foleys body to Turkey BuzzFeed reported Wednesday in a piece detailing exchanges with middlemen with ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria using another name for the marauding group which has murdered and plundered its way to controlling large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria. One of the middlemen a Syrian rebel told BuzzFeed he was approached by an IS commanders seeking to make the deal with the US government or with Foleys family. The man who reportedly managed hostage negotiations with the al Qaeda affiliate Nusra Front said the motivation was to provide closure for the family a humanity case Another intermediary was much more to the point telling the popular site This is business. A third point person mentioned in the report was an official in the US backed Free Syrian Army rebel group who urged the site not to publish details of a potential deal for fear it could be sabotaged. It will be like a shame for the US government the FSA official told BuzzFeed. People will ask why you brought the body but you did not bring him when he was alive. The Islamic State has made a lucrative business of hostage taking — reportedly trading 15 European nationals and others for between 35 45 million earlier this year — but this report indicates the terror group has turned a revolting new page. They were trying to negotiate for his freedom before they beheaded him and after beheading him they are trying to sell his body the FSA official said according to the report. The group is not starved for funds however with its ransom business black market oil sales and tax collection raking in up to 800 million per year according to reports. Just this week analysts said the terror organization spent no less than an estimated 200000 on a propaganda video that featured the beheading of 22 Syrian soldiers and that took between four and six hours to film. This still image taken from an undated video published on the Internet by Islamic State terrorists on November 16 2014 purports to show IS marching Syrian soldiers before beheading them. This still image taken from an undated video published on the Internet by Islamic State terrorists on November 16 2014 purports to show IS marching Syrian soldiers before beheading them. The propaganda video released on November 16 and called Though the Unbelievers Despise It shows the simultaneous executions of the Syrian soldiers as well as the beheading of Kassig. In the video the killers appear to be led by a masked Jihadi John the British IS militant believed to be responsible for the beheadings of Kassig as well as Foley Sotloff Haine and Henning. In light of the large numbers of radicalized foreigners who have joined the Islamic State analysts from all over the world have been studying the clip in an effort to identify the rest of the killers. A recent UN report estimates an unprecedented influx of 15000 foreign fighters from 80 countries who have joined the Islamic States relentless campaigns in Iraq and Syria
2316,A fourth grader named Aiden Steward was suspended Friday after school officials determined he had threatened to use his magic ring to make another boy disappear. Here are the particulars from The Odessa American His father Jason Steward said the family had been to see The Hobbit The Battle of the Five Armies last weekend. His son brought a ring to his class at Kermit Elementary School and told another boy his magic ring could make the boy disappear. Steward said the principal said threats to another childs safety would not be tolerated – whether magical or not. Principal Roxanne Greer declined to comment on the matter. All student stuff is confidential Greer said. She referred a call from the Odessa American to Kermit ISD Superintendent Bill Boyd who did not return a phone call. The New York Daily News followed up with the Stewards. I assure you my son lacks the magical powers necessary to threaten his friends existence the boys father told NYDN. If he did I am sure he had bring him right back
1044,After deploying tear gas to break up pro democracy demonstrators police in Hong Kong warned late Sunday local time that they will use a higher level of force against the crowds of thousands if public order is not restored. Demonstrators have gathered outside government headquarters near the citys financial district calling for the Chinese government to grant democratic reforms in Hong Kong. An overwhelming amount of protesters were seen mimicking the symbolic hands up do not shoot gesture used throughout protests in Ferguson Missouri over the killing of unarmed teen Michael Brown. Students – many of whom have already boycotted a week of classes – and activists began camping out on Friday and were later joined by members of a civil disobedience movement known as Occupy Central. Protesters told the Associated Press that the demonstrations were peaceful when riot police started to use pepper spray and launch tear gas canisters. That sent coughing protesters running in all directions but many later reconvened vowing to keep the rally going. Police officers were wearing both helmets and respirators to protect them from the gas. Government leaders in Hong Kong and Beijing called the demonstrations unlawful and illegal respectively but many protesters say they will not waver. If today I do not stand out I will hate myself in future taxi driver Edward Yeung told Reuters. Even if I get a criminal record he said it will be a glorious one. Hong Kong does have some some autonomy from Beijing which took over sovereignty of the former British colony in 1997. But Beijing has asserted more control in the city in recent months. This includes requiring Beijings approval of election candidates and allegations of intimidation from mainland officials on free business practices in Hong Kong according to The Washington Post. Occupy Central vowed to protest the Chinese governments actions back in June when the citys Beijing backed leader said a trio of reforms the group was suggesting failed to comply with existing laws The New York Times reported. Beijing has promised Hong Kong a free election to choose its leader by 2017 but pro democracy supporters there and Chinese officials on the mainland have so far failed to agree on guidelines for such a vote. Government officials in Hong Kong warned that the continued demonstrations may disrupt public transport in the financial hub on Monday Reuters reported. Police have not used tear gas in Hong Kong in nearly a decade according to NBC News. The tactic was last used in 2005 during World Trade Organization protests. We will fight until the end one protester told NBC News. We will never give up. Another protester – a student named Alexandra Wong – said We will not just say yes to whatever they do. We will fight for our rights and fight for our democracy
2107,Christina Fernández de Kirchner the president of Argentina got a new addition to her family last week when she adopted a 13 year old Jewish boy named Yair Tawil as her godson the Independent reports. Her motivations for doing so are based on a centuries old legend that seventh sons will transform into werewolves. In Argentina the werewolf is referred to as el lobison in Paraguay it goes by the name Luison and in Brazil it is called the Lobisomem. The Independent elaborates on the South American legend The werewolf like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boys 13th birthday the legend says turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form. As well as feeding on excrement unbaptized babies and the flesh of the recently dead the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite. In Guaraní mythology the lobison is the offspring of Tau an evil spirit and Kerana a mortal woman. In the cultures that believe in the lobison that creature acts as a sort of Grim Reaper whose mere presence means that death will soon befall those it comes into contact with. As the Independent explains by the 19th century fear of this creature was so acute in Argentina that families sometimes murdered their seventh sons to prevent the legend from coming true. So in 1907 in an attempt to stop this practice the Argentinean president began adopting seventh sons which the president insisted would stop the curse. In 1973 the Independent adds the presidential adoption tradition was also extended to seventh daughters. In addition to being able to say he is the presidents godson Tawil will receive a gold medal and enjoy a full educational scholarship. In modern times the curse it seems is more aptly described as a blessing
253,Abu Bakr al Baghdadi pictured in a propaganda video earlier this year. Photo AP The US led coalition unleashed airstrikes near the Iraqi city of Mosul targeting top jihadist militants but the fate of the Islamic State groups enigmatic leader remained unclear. Claims swirled that hardline IS chief Abu Bakr al Baghdadi had been killed in the attacks late Friday but US officials could not confirm if he had even been present. The news came after US President Barack Obama unveiled plans to send up to 1500 more US troops to Iraq to help battle the militants who have seized a large swathe of territory. In fresh violence some 33 people were killed in a wave of car bombings against Shiite areas in the capital Baghdad highlighting again the security challenge facing Iraqis even within government controlled zones. US Central Command confirmed that coalition aircraft conducted a series of airstrikes against a gathering of ISIL leaders near Mosul. A convoy of 10 armoured vehicles from the group also known as ISIL was destroyed. We can not confirm if ISIL leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was among those present CENTCOM spokesman Patrick Ryder said in his statement. A strike against Baghdadi who has proclaimed himself the caliph of a state straddling Iraq and Syria would be a major coup for the US led coalition. Washington has offered a US10 million reward for his capture and some analysts say he is increasingly seen as more powerful than al Qaeda chief Ayman al Zawahiri. In a video posted online in July purportedly the first known footage of Baghdadi he ordered all Muslims to obey him during a Ramadan sermon in Mosul. Al Arabiya TV reported Baghdadi had been wounded while a local Iraqi channel said one of his aides was killed. Iraqi leaders said the new US military trainers who will aid its fight against jihadists are welcome but come late. Ryder added the US led strikes were a further sign of the pressure we continue to place on the ISIL terrorist network. The aim was to squeeze the group and ensure it had increasingly limited freedom to manoeuvre communicate and command. The new troops will roughly double the number of American soldiers already in the country and marks a deepening US commitment in the open ended war. This step is a little late but we welcome it a statement from Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al Abadis office said. The government had requested that members of the international coalition help train and arm its forces the statement said. Multiple Iraqi army divisions collapsed in the early days of the jihadist northern offensive leaving major units that need to be reconstituted. AFP
284,After a number of complaints from passengers about random males being seated next to their wives Saudi Arabias national airline is looking in to segregating their flights. Saudi Arabias national airline Saudia will order its staff to keep men and women seated separately on flights from now on after passengers complained about the lack of segregation on their flights. The Emirates247 news website reported that the airline which already complies with many of the religious practices of Islam including not offering alcohol or dishes that contain pork on their flights have decided to separate men and women on board unless they are close relatives. Abdul Rahman Al Fahd Saudias assistant manager for marketing said that there are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers. According to RTcom Saudia is not the first airline to encounter these issues after Israeli carrier El Al faced delays to a flight back in October as Orthodox Jews refused to be seated next to women on the plane while Delta have also faced a similar issue both occurring on flights between Tel Aviv and New York
2584,Millions may lose coverage next year if Congress does not repeal Obamacare. that is not what this weeks Congressional Budget Office analysis says but it is reality. CBOs estimating models seem impervious to reality. In the real world the Obamacare exchanges are in crisis millions of uninsured people willingly pay or avoid IRS penalties and consumers struggle with rising premiums and cost sharing requirements. But for CBO Obamacare is a sea of tranquility. The agency assumes that only 26 million people under the age of 65 will be uninsured this year and next if Obamacare is left in place. To hit that mark 2 million fewer people would have to be uninsured this year than last. That seems unlikely. The National Health Interview Survey estimates that 279 million people under age 65 lacked coverage as of September 30 last year the most recent date for which government survey data are available. That represents little improvement over its estimate of 284 million as of December 2015 meaning that the number of non elderly uninsured declined by only half a million through the first nine months of last year. Since then the Obamacare individual exchanges have begun to implode. Fewer people signed up during the open enrollment period this year than last due in part to premium hikes that averaged 25 percent. Other insurance companies did not bother raising prices they fled the exchanges. By January 1000 counties were down to their last insurer. Five entire states have just a single company selling through the exchanges. A rational observer might worry that the exchanges were on the brink of doom. Not CBO. Its analysts believe that Obamacare is on the cusp of a miracle. The number of nonelderly uninsured not only will drop this year but hold steady in 2018 according to CBO even though millions could find themselves without an insurer in their exchanges. That improbably happy outcome would change the agency says if Congress were to enact its repeal bill. In that case CBO warns the number of uninsured will abruptly increase by 4 million. That includes 2 million Medicaid beneficiaries. CBO believes they will drop out of a program for which they pay virtually nothing and that fully pays virtually all their medical expenses. Ditto for 1 million people in the exchanges and an additional million with job based coverage. CBO believes that these 4 million people so detest being insured that they will drop out of the system immediately after Congress repeals the tax on the uninsured. That number will rise to 14 million next year according to CBO. That includes 5 million who will abandon Medicaid 2 million who will drop their employer sponsored coverage and 6 million who will leave the exchanges. These 14 million people will not despite what you have read lose coverage. For the most part CBO says they will choose not to have insurance because they chose to be covered by insurance under current law only to avoid paying penalties emphasis added. The GOP bill not only retains existing subsidies and Medicaid expansion through 2019 it provides additional money to states to stabilize their failing Obamacare exchanges. But that spending according to CBO will not halt the stampede to the Obamacare exits induced by repeal of the individual mandate. CBOs illusions about the effectiveness of the mandate do not square with reality. The evidence suggests that the mandate has done little to reduce the number of uninsured. The IRS reports that in 2015 65 million paid the penalty 127 million obtained an exemption while 43 million simply ignored it. that is 235 million people who have chosen to be uninsured despite the governments threat of tax penalties. CBOs estimates of the effects of the GOP bill are deeply flawed. let us do the math. NHIS estimates that 443 million non elderly were uninsured in 2013 the year before Obamacare was fully implemented. If CBO is to be believed the number of uninsured will increase by 14 million next year joining another 235 million uninsured people who either paid the tax in the past or found a way to avoid it. That would mean that 85 percent of the uninsured apparently would want nothing to do with Obamacares government defined and subsidized benefits were Congress to repeal the individual mandate. If CBO is correct the government will have spent 462 billion between 2014 and 2018 on subsidies and Medicaid expansions only to end up reducing the number of nonelderly uninsured from 443 million to 41 million. It is also possible that CBO is wrong about the individual mandate. That seems intuitively obvious to people whose heads are not buried in CBOs faulty models. Some future progressive government may well decide to attack the problem of homelessness by supplementing the mortgage interest deduction with a tax on the homeless. But does anyone believe that if a Republican Congress repealed that tax homeowners would shred their mortgages and head to the grates. CBOs estimates of the effects of the GOP bill are deeply flawed. They begin with rosy assumptions about the current law. In the face of considerable contrary evidence they assume that insurers will continue to sell in the exchanges next year and that there will be no appreciable disruption in coverage. They appear to believe that higher coverage rates that have occurred since 2014 are more attributable to tax penalties than to subsidies despite feckless IRS enforcement. And they assume that even if Congress keeps the tax credits and Medicaid expansion in place next year and spends additional money to stabilize insurance markets 14 million more people will join the ranks of the uninsured. Congress should set policy based on reality not on CBOs speculations. Obamacare exchanges are falling apart Medicaid spending is growing at an excessive pace and taxing the uninsured is both ineffective and politically unsustainable. The House and Senate should act now to stabilize those markets repeal the law and replace it with a system that puts doctors and patients in control of health care decision making
278,A 17 year old Mpumalanga girl who poured acid on her boyfriends genitals to punish him for distributing a pornographic video he made of her without her knowledge has blamed anger for her actions. Girl destroys boyfriends penis in acid attack after video of them having sex goes viral Girl destroys boyfriends penis in acid attack after video of them having sex goes viral I never intended to kill his penis. I was just angry and all I wanted was to make him feel the pain I was feeling she told a Sapa correspondent. I heard about the video from one of my classmates and I thought that they were joking but then I saw the video myself and lost my mind. The girl whose name is known to a Sapa correspondent but can not be published because she is a minor attacked Humphrey Khoza 25 with battery acid while he was drinking beer with friends at a tavern in Cork village near Hazyview on January 17. She said Khoza had tricked her because she was not aware he was not using a condom or that he was filming them. I had to do something to show him that I was angry and wanted to hurt him so that he can see that he messed with the wrong girl she said. She searched in her fathers tools for a wheel spanner she could use to teach Khoza a lesson. While I was searching I came across an old acid bottle. I took it and went straight to his regular drinking place and when I got there I became angrier. I did not hesitate to pour the acid on him she said. Khoza who had no problem with his name being published but asked not to be photographed said he had been dating the girl since December. Everything happened in a blink of an eye because I saw her when she was coming with a bottle but I did not realise that she was carrying acid. She just angrily called me a dog he said. She asked how in the world I could have done such an evil thing to her. It was only then that I realised that she was talking about the video that I took while we were having sex. In the video Khoza is seen pushing the girl in her school uniform onto a bed. He added that the sex was consensual. We agreed to have sex but she was not aware that I was filming the sex using my laptop computer. I did not intend to show anyone the video and I still do not know how it got onto social media he said. The remorseful Khoza added that although his penis would never work again due to the damage caused by the acid he was lucky to be alive. He said he was advised to press charges against the girl but does not see the point. Even if I press charges it is useless because it will not bring back my manhood. Her being in jail will just ruin her future because she is still young and I do not have the energy to attend courts said Khoza. He now has to urinate through a tube and has to undergo surgery. The girl said she was also considering pressing charges relating to his creation of pornography. According to the Film and Publications Act child pornography is defined as any image or any description of a person real or simulated who is or who is depicted or described as being under the age of 18 years engaged in sexual conduct. When asked for comment Calcutta police said they would open a case if either of the two came forward
2071,A man purported to be the reclusive leader of the militant Islamic State Abu Bakr al Baghdadi has made what would be his first public appearance at a mosque in the center of Iraqs second city Mosul according to a video recording posted on the Internet on July 5 2014 in this still image taken from video. There had previously been reports on social media that Abu Bakr al Baghdadi would make his first public appearance since his Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant changed its name to the Islamic State and declared him caliph. The Iraqi government denied that the video which carried Fridays date was credible. It was also not possible to immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording or the date when it was made. Iraqi officials said Sunday that Abu Bakr al Baghdadi the leader of ISIS or Islamic State terror group was wounded in a US led airstrike on a convoy of militants in Iraq and a security strategist said the attack killed his close aide. While Pentagon officials said they can not confirm whether al Baghdadi was in the convoy that was targeted Iraqs Defense and Interior Ministries issued statements saying the ISIS leader had been wounded according to The Associated Press. An Iraqi Interior Ministry intelligence official also cited informants within the terror group as saying that the ISIS leader was hit in the town of Qaim in Iraqs western Anbar province. Auf Abdulrahman Elefery a very close companion of al Baghdadi and also known as Abu Suja was killed along with several other members of the ISIS when planes struck the groups convoy on Friday night Hisham al Hashimi an Iraqi security strategist told The Telegraph. He and Baghdadi were rarely separate. it is for this reason that it could be possible that Baghdadi was with him at the time of the attack al Hashimi was quoted as saying. There are more 20 other people were killed in the US air strike but they are not senior in the organization. Baghdadi was supposedly an Islamic preacher at the time of the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. He later became a militant and was briefly detained by American forces at Camp Bucca according to Defense Department officials. Baghdadi who is in his early 40s and has a 10 million US bounty on his head then allegedly met and received training from al Qaeda operatives and later became the leader of the ISIS. The US led coalition has been conducting airstrikes on ISIS positions in Iraq and Syria since August. On Friday US led airstrikes destroyed a convoy of 10 armed trucks in the attacks on a gathering of ISIS leaders near Mosul. A Mosul morgue official said about 50 bodies of ISIS militants were brought to the facility after the airstrikes. The US has now also doubled the number of its troops in Iraq to fight ISIS militants. While there are about 1400 US troops in Iraq President Obama Friday authorized Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to send 1500 more troops to train and assist Iraqi forces in fighting ISIS militants as was requested by Iraqs government. ISIS an al Qaeda offshoot also known as ISIL now controls large parts of territories in Iraq and Syria and seeks to form an Islamic emirate in the Levant region through jihad. ISIS is seen as the most brutal jihadist terror group. According to reports US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning who have been beheaded by ISIS militants were subjected to severe physical torture including waterboarding and a majority of them converted to Islam under duress

160,Isis fighters are reportedly just one mile away from Baghdad as reports emerge of al Qaeda militants bolstering their ranks in Syria. According to the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East Isis was approaching the Iraqi capital on Monday morning report The Independent. The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad a spokesperson said. They said it could never happen and now it almost has. Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to be here a very short while to know they can do very very little. The news comes amid reports of an emerging alliance between Isis forces in Syria and Jabhat al Nusra also known as the Nusra Front. The group is the Syrian offshoot of al Qaeda and has been fighting against the Assad regime in the civil war. Despite months of clashes between its forces and Isis militants the two groups appear to be forming a loose coalition in parts of the country to fight increasing attacks by the US and its allies. Advertisement Al Nusras official spokesperson Abu Firas al Suri threatened the coalition nations with retaliation on Saturday. These states have committed a horrible act that is going to put them on the list of jihadist targets throughout the world he said. This is not a war against al Nusra but a war against Islam. Al Nusra and Isis leaders are now holding war planning meetings together a source told the Guardian although no formal alliance has been confirmed. The reports follow growing defections from other Islamist groups to Isis which is seen as better organised and equipped to create an Islamic State straddling Iraq and Syria. A loyalty pledge was reportedly made by al Nusra in June in the town of Al Bukamal near the Iraqi border the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said and the two groups have fought together against Government forces. The report appeared to be confirmed on Twitter by a photograph showing an Egyptian al Nusra Front commander shaking hands with an Isis leader of Chechen origin. Although both Isis and al Nusra are rooted in al Qaeda the two have been rivals since Isis started its involvement in Syrias civil war in spring last year and have engaged in bloody battles killing more than 3000 militants from both sides. A merger had been declared by Isis leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi in 2013 when Isis was known as al Qaeda in Iraq but the alliance was rejected by al Nusra and overruled by al Qaeda leader al Zawahiri. But the international response to Isis bloody rampage through Iraq and Syria and the beheadings of British and American hostages is pushing the groups towards an alliance. An al Nusra source told Reuters There are hardline voices inside Nusra who are pushing for reconciliation with Islamic State. A formal alliance is believed to only be possible on the orders of al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri. A deal between the militant groups would strengthen the Islamist force in Syria as air strikes cripple Isis funding sources equipment stores and slow its advances. The US has not said al Nusra is being targeted but its planes have attacked a new group called Khorasan which some analysts suspect is part of al Nusra. The two groups have been known to co operate and Khorasan is believed to be made up of veteran al Qaeda fighters with battlefield experience mostly in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Britain the US and the United Nations are among those who have classed al Nusra as a terrorist group citing its use of suicide bombing terrorist attacks and attempts to impose Islamic law. A small number of anti Government groups including some members for the secular Free Syrian Army opposed the label after al Nusra gained respect fighting the Assad regime
1558,If there is one thing Apple currently lacks it is a good social layer to their various offerings. Perhaps to satiate our need to be digitally social Apple is reportedly close to purchasing the nearly four year old Path. Insiders say the deal may already be done too. According to Pando Daily one well placed source on Apples Engineering squad says it is almost done if not signed already but it is essentially a done deal. So why is Apple interested in Path if they indeed are. In a way they are kindred. Path struggles to find users but that is obviously not why they and Apple are so similar. If anything positive can be said of Path it is with their design. they have been widely lauded as a heavy hitter when it comes to UI and experience something Apple covets in their own right. Further evidence of this comes with news that Dave Morin — current Path CEO and former Apple employee — was spotted sitting front and center at Apples iPhone 6Apple Watch event yesterday. that is a spot typically reserved for top brass and partners not the CEO if a hit and miss social platform Apple has no involvement in. Apple snapping up Path is also said to be more than an acquihire to get folks like Morin back in the fold. Pandos source says Path will survive the acquisition whole and be cobbled into Apples revamped Messaging app. It seems a likely acquisition and it will be interesting to see how Apple works Path into their fold. Path is good but suffers the same ghost town moniker that haunts other social platforms like Google. But hey at least it will probably work out better than Apples previous social experiment right.

157,The woman claiming to have 3 boobs is A FRAUD A FAKE and ironically what exposed her lie is a crime someone committed against her. Jasmine Tridevil has been making the rounds claiming she got plastic surgery to netted her an additional boob. But we got a document from the Tampa International Airport Police Dept. describing a baggage theft. According to the doc someone stole a bunch of luggage off an American Airlines conveyor belt including a black nylon roller bag. Cops caught the thieves after IDing them with surveillance video. The black bag belonged to Tridevel but before she got it back it was inventoried by police as part of the case against the crooks. Guess what was inside the bag. A 3 breast prosthesis. BTW she told cops the prosthesis was valued at 5K. The boobs are perfect but she is a little crooked
2270,After news broke yesterday that Jasmine Tridevil 21 of Tampa had allegedly paid 20000 to have a third boob implanted on her chest to make herself unattractive to men we have heard whispers in the wind that this Third Boob is a stunt a hoax. It very well might be. http gawkercomwoman gets thi Professional debunkers Snopes has classified Tridevils third boob story as FALSE largely because almost all of the alleged evidence is coming directly from Tridevil herself No family members or friends have confirmed the surgery first hand. And Tridevil claims the doctor who performed the surgery forced her to sign a non disclosure agreement conveniently making his or her testimony unattainable. They point out that in this YouTube video posted to her page Tridevils alleged third boob is a different skin tone then the rest of her body. Trivdevil granted an exclusive interview with WTSP last night where she briefly flashed all three of her breasts. When the reporter asked for another longer look Tridevil declined telling the reporter I am not ready to do that right now because it is in episode six of my show. Yes Tridevil purports to be self producing a reality series she hopes will be picked up by a television network. Fitting because according to the snoops at Snopes this apparently is not the first time Tridevil has tried to turn herself into a star. Well a woman claiming to be Jasmine Tridevil at least jasminetridevilcom which has since expired was registered to a Alisha Hessler one who bears a striking resemblance to a Tampa massage therapist that has had brushes with viral fame before. Last year Hessler allegedly made the man who beat her wear a dunce cap and hold a sign reading I BEAT WOMEN HONK IF A SCUMBAG in a busy intersection. Police made multiple attempts to follow up with Hessler about the incident but she apparently refused all the calls. And in March of 2013 Snopes reports Hessler was booked in Tampa on a fraudulent use of personal information charge. Doctors have confirmed that no surgeon in their right mind would allow this surgery to ever happen namely because TridevilHesslers case raises mental health red flags. Nilesh Sojitra of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons told BuzzFeed This is a clear case of a patient who should not have had surgery performed on her. Someone making this kind of request may have body dysmorphia disorder or not have thought through the long term consequences of such a surgery – she will now be scarred for life – and may have benefited from psychological evaluation rather than surgery. Additionally the actions of the surgeon are unethical and they have acted in a way where no reasonable plastic surgeon would. And Dr Dan Greenwald of Bayshore Plastic Surgery told WTSP I think its very extreme and that leads me to wonder why she needs this attention. Is there some instability. Is there something psychologically lacking or out of balance for this person. So it would appear unlikely that the Third Boob is real. That is the truth. But the truth is we all have a third boob—our hearts. It beats when you believe in yourself. It beats when you chase your dreams. So while this Third Boob might just be a Halloween costume prosthetic used to hop on the easily started viral joy ride the Third Boob in all of us beats on. Image via WTSP

1172,A 25 year old man can no longer use his penis after his 17 year old girlfriend poured acid on his genitals to punish him for distributing a pornographic video he had taken of her without her knowledge. SAVE SHARE EMAILPRINT The girl whose name is known to African Eye News Service but can not be published because she is under age attacked Humphrey Khoza with battery acid while he was drinking beers with friends at a tavern in Cork village near Hazyview Mpumalanga on January 17. Everything happened in a blink of an eye because I saw her when she was coming with a bottle but I did not realise that she was carrying acid. She just angrily called me a dog. She asked how in the world I could have done such an evil thing to her. It was only then that I realised that she was talking about the video that I took while we were having sex said Khoza. Khoza said he had been dating the schoolgirl since December. We agreed to have sex but she was not aware that I was filming the sex using my laptop computer. I did not intend to show anyone the video and I still do not know how it got onto social media he said. In the viral video that AENS has seen to verify the claims Khoza is seen pushing the girl who was in her school uniform to the bed. She appeared not to notice that she was being filmed while they had sex. The remorseful Khoza added that although his penis would never work again due to the damage caused by the acid he was lucky to be alive. He said he was advised to press charges against the girl but does not see the point. Even if I press charges it is useless because it will not bring back my manhood. Her being in jail will just ruin her future because she is still young and I do not have the energy to attend courts said Khoza. He now has to urinate through a tube and has to undergo surgery
2499,The highly anticipated Apple Watch which has had a mysterious official launch date is finally going to be released in April. Tim Cook revealed the timing of the release of the Apple Watch during a conference call with analysts clarifying the exact month of the devices launch which Apple previously said would be in early 2015. Development for Apple Watch is right on schedule said Cook. we are going to be thrilled to start shipping it because we have a lot of customers wanting to get one he said referring to the companys first new product since the iPad. Apple is entering the smartwatch industry a little late as it did with the iPhone and the iPad in the smartphone and tablet computer industries but it is looking to define the segment with the Apple Watch. Rival companies have launched smartwatches over the past several months but the devices have not taken off in the market. The Apple Watch was unveiled in September last year with the company revealing that the price of the device would begin at 349. While the basic functions of the device are now known there are still many questions surrounding the device such as the cost of high end models and whether the Apple Watch would have a killer app that could drastically boost the devices sales. Apple news website 9to5 Mac acquired information regarding the Apple Watch Edition the more expensive model that will include gold. The website claims that Apples official stores will be outfitted with safes such as in jewelry stores to house the devices. The safes which will likely be utilized to hold inventory for sale as well as to safeguard demo units will include the MagSafe chargers for the Apple Watch to keep the held units fully charged. The news website also claims that Apple has already started the installation of the safes in certain stores ahead of the devices launch date. Previous reports said that the price of the gold plated Apple Watch Edition could reach thousands of dollars. Ben Reitzes an analyst for Barclays believes that the launch of the smartwatch seems to be a bit delayed but Cooks statement that April still qualifies as early 2015 is sufficient. Cook said that he has been trying out the Apple Watch daily adding that he can not live without it. The Apple CEO also said that there is an impressive number of developers working on apps for the Apple Watch
2179,If you are an American and you have been watching the pro democracy protests in Hong Kong closely you may have noticed something familiar a number of the young demonstrators are using the same hands up do not shoot gesture that became a symbol of last months protests in faraway Ferguson Missouri. Hong Kongs protesters have good reason to put their hands up police are using what many observers describe as an unprecedented level of force against the demonstrations which are rallying against the Chinese government for reneging on its promise to grant them full democracy in 2017. While injuries in the protests have been relatively few so far the clashes have been bad enough that Hong Kongers appear to earnestly fear the police might crack down violently and that anxiety is showing in these photos. it is impossible to say the degree to which protesters are using the gesture as a deliberate nod to Ferguson or borrowing something they had seen on the news for their own purposes or using it coincidentally. But Hong Kongers particularly young Hong Kongers pride themselves on being plugged in to the world so it is well within the realm of possibility that they followed the events in Ferguson and are now appropriating the gesture for their own use. Some of the protesters are organized within a group called Occupy Central named for Hong Kongs Central financial district and for the global protest movement that began with Occupy Wall Street. it is fascinating to see a symbol of the fight against racism and police violence in America become a symbol of democracy and freedom halfway around the world however it got there

Supposedly Brunos publicist Vladimir Kershov leaked the private information and was subsequently fired for his actions.

473,The luxury version of the Apple Watch made from 18 carat rose or yellow gold will be kept in safes within stores according to sources. The Apple Watch Edition is expected to retail for thousands and will go on sale with the standard Apple Watch and Apple Watch by April Tim Cook confirmed last week. In a bid to keep the expensive timepieces secure Apple has begun installing safes in stores sources told 9to5Mac.

710,The family of slain journalist James Foley are claiming Obama Administration officials repeatedly threatened them asserting that they could be prosecuted for supporting terrorism if they paid a ransom to the ISIS militants holding their son. Both Foleys mother and brother made the allegations this week according to ABC News. The threats which were made to the Foley family over the summer reportedly came from a highly decorated military official who serves on the White Houses National Security Council. Five current or former officials with knowledge of the Foley case made the same allegation to ABC News in recent weeks. Three times he intimidated us with that message Diane Foley claimed. We were horrified he would say that. He just told us we would be prosecuted. We knew we had to save our son we had to try. US threatened family of beheaded journo JamesFoley wterrorism charge if they paid 2 save him http tco4Ts3uJ4iEB pictwittercomjzAE04cWkA — Keegan Stephan September 12 2014 The NSC released a statement on Thursday in which spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden addressed the implications of paying ransom to terrorist groups. Without getting into the details of our private discussions with families the law is clear that ransom payments to designated individuals or entities such as ISIL ISIS are prohibited. It is also a matter of longstanding policy that the US does not grant concessions to hostage takers. Doing so would only put more Americans at risk of being taken captive. That is what we convey publicly and what we convey privately. Officials also told Foleys family not to deal with the press and indicated that the government would not exchange prisoners or take military action to rescue James Foley according to CNN. Foleys brother Michael also claimed that he was directly threatened with prosecution. Jim was killed in the most horrific way. He was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination lack of communication lack of prioritization Diane Foley said adding As a family we had to find our way through this on our own. VIDEO CNN Foleys mom Our country let Jim down http tcoehv21YQ8KD pictwittercomSQYkWQO8ck — MSN News September 12 2014 As The Inquisitr has previously reported James Foley was murdered by ISIS militants and a video posted online on August 19 shows his summary execution by beheading. In the weeks following his death it was revealed that the United States had launched a mission to recover Foley and other captives this summer inside Syria though the hostages had been moved by the time commandos arrived. Foleys family said that the threats slowed their fundraising efforts to obtain the ransom as they feared donors would also face prosecution. Image via ABC News
2189,A five year old boy in Torpoint England ended up missing a friends birthday party and he did it without any advance notice. Due to his no show at his friends party the young child was actually given an invoice and billed for his nonappearance. According to the Plymouth Herald Derek Nash says that his son Alex was given a childs party no show fee invoice for not going to a friends birthday party. The bill for £1595 was in his sons school bag last week and Nash thought it was a joke. The party was scheduled for before the Christmas holidays when Alex was invited to one of his Torpoint Nursery and Infant School classmates birthday party. It was being held at the Ski Slope and Snowboard Centre and the Nash family indicated that Alex would be attending the party. She saw me and asked if Alex was coming to the party. At this time I agreed and said that Alex was looking forward to it. As the Metro stated Nash informed the classmates mother in person that his son would be going to the party. It was after that conversation that Nash realized the family already had a family trip planned for that day. Upon trying to cancel Alexs acceptance to the party Nash found no way to contact the party thrower. We did not have a contact number email or an address to let the boys mother know. So on the day of the party we asked Alex what he wanted to do – he chose to be with his grandparents. It was a week later that the invoice for Alexs no show was received. A teacher at the Torpoint Nursery and Infant School is actually the one who put the notice in the boys school bag and the school has since issued an apology for their involvement in the matter. Alexs teacher said that she would let all staff know that giving the boy an invoice was a breach of protocol. Derek Nash said he then left the school and went to visit the birthday boys mother since her address was now on the invoice. He let her know that he would not be paying her the money and that she should have spoken to me first. The birthday boys mother has since threatened the Nash family with legal action and could possibly take them to small claims court to get the money she is owed. As for Alex Nash and his classmate at the Torpoint Nursery. He has told his parents that his classmate will not play with him at school now since he was a no show to the party and the invoice was given out. Image via Plymouth Herald
1259,Dead or alive. Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi. Photo AP Beirut The fate of the self proclaimed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi remains unclear with rumours that he was wounded in a US air strike in Iraq still unconfirmed. The United States Central Command said coalition aircraft did conduct a series of airstrikes on a convoy in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul where it is thought there was a gathering of Islamic State leaders. It is believed there were at least 50 casualties from the attack. However Colonel Patrick Ryder a spokesman at Central Command said We can not confirm if ISIL leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was among those present the Guardian reported. One of Baghdadis key aides Abdul Rahman al Athaee is known to have died in the attack and as he was known to travel with the leadership it has prompted a raft of speculation as to the well being of Baghdadi. A Twitter account purported to be run by an IS spokesman Abu Mohammed al Adnani appeared to confirm the self declared caliph had been injured. Perhaps you suspected that the caliphate ended with martyrdom of the caliph. I assure the Islamic nation that the Emir Abu Bakr al Baghdadi is well thank God and I wish him a speedy recovery. However commentators have cast doubt on those comments with some labelling the Twitter account a fake. Two people who say they witnessed an airstrike on a house near the western Iraqi border town of al Qaim where senior Islamic State officials were meeting told Reuters the militants had evacuated a local hospital so their wounded could be treated. Meanwhile an Iraqi Interior Ministry official told Associated Press on Sunday that the strike on al Qaim in Anbar province had wounded Baghdadi while a senior Iraqi military official also said he had heard Baghdadi had been wounded in the attack. Baghdadis last public appearance was in a mosque in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul in July in which he declared himself the leader of a new caliphate that stretched from Syria into Iraq. One commentator and author Juan Cole cautioned against placing too much hope that – should the death of Baghdadi be confirmed – the Islamic State would be weakened. The US has killed a long line of al Qaeda leaders by now from Abu Musab al Zarqawi in 2006 to Bin Laden himself Mr Cole wrote on his Informed Comment blog on Sunday. The militarys theory that leadership is rare and attrition wrought on leaders is decisive in defeating a group is simply incorrect. ISILs toolbox of terrorising and coercing people is available to large numbers of people. Britains chief of defence staff General Sir Nick Houghton also warned that Islamic State would regroup if its leader had been killed. Speaking to the BBC General Houghton said What I would not want to do is rush to the sense that the potential death of one of their totemic leaders is going to create some strategic reverse within IS. They will regenerate leadership … because of the current potential attractiveness of this warped ideology. Unless we get the political dimension of the strategy in place then IS has the potential to keep regenerating and certainly regenerating its leaders
1285,A 19 year old from Brighton is reportedly among five British jihadis killed in the American airstrikes against Islamic State in Syria. The mother of Ibrahim Kamara learned of her sons death through social media after the US strikes on the country primarily aimed at Islamic Sate on Tuesday The Guardian reported. An image was posted to Facebook which has not been verified that apparently shows Kamara in an unzipped body bag. News of Ibrahim Kamaras death reached his mother by social media If it is confirmed he is among the first Britons killed in Syria by US action. Kamara who was known as Khalil al Britani is thought to have been fighting for al Nusra an affiliate group of al Qaeda is believed to have been one of five men killed in a drone strike on Aleppo. His mother Khadijah Kamara 35 told The Guardian her son rang her in February to say he was in Syria and she hung up. When he rang again she told him do not ever call me again. After his death she said I cried when I could not do anything about it. I cried then. what is left to cry now. I have three other boys I have to be strong for them. She told ITV News I knew something like this if someones in a warzone area. When asked about how she felt about her son being in Syria she said I have always been angry inside. I could not believe it I could not believe a member of my family could even think about this kind of thing. She said she was angry at people who brainwashed her son and the airport for allowing him to travel to the warzone on his 15 year old brothers passport. Who would let someone travel on a 15 year olds passport. It was not his passport yet he got away with it. I will never figure this out. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said We are aware of reports of the death of a British national in Syria

1186,On October 27 rumors began to spread on social media that a Kurdish female fighter known by the pseudonym Rehana may have been beheaded by Islamic State militants in Kobani. Dubbed the poster child for Kobani female warriors Rehana a fighter in the Kurdish YPJ militia captured the publics imagination after her photograph was circulated on the internet. The image of Rehana making a victory sign was retweeted hundreds of times along with the claim that she was singlehandedly responsible for killing over a hundred ISIS militants. While there has been no confirmation of Rehanas death several news outlets including Australias 9News reported that she may have been beheaded citing a graphic image of a beheaded Kurdish female fighter that had been shared on pro IS social media accounts. There is no way to verify if the image which shows an IS militant holding the head of a decapitated woman — is genuine or if it is Rehana. However the same gruesome photograph has been circulating since at least October 5 on pro ISIS accounts. The fact that the claims and rumors of Rehanas possible brutal killing have garnered so much attention is testament to the enormous public interest in female fighters in the Syrian Kurdish YPJ and Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga militias. Reports have dubbed the women badass battle hardened and fanatical fighters. The interest is unsurprising these are all female fighters waging war on ISIS militants who are not only a formidable military force but whose repressive and violent Islamist ideology is in stark contrast to any progressive feminist philosophy that allows women to go to war. Throughout the 40 day siege of Kobani images of female Kurdish fighters have circulated widely on social media With a gun and a guitar Kurdish female fighters in the streets of Kobane KobaneResistance. pictwittercomfD1tWCwNht This tweet included a photograph of Rehanna Airdrop2Kobane because Kurdish female fighters of the Women Protection Unit rather die than living under ISIS rule pictwittercomUygfWa52DE The images of young Kurdish women fighting for Kobani has also inspired artistic expression Female fighters of YPG in Kobane. pictwittercomk5n3v3Vnva The widespread interest in Kurdish female fighters and their battle against IS militants in Kobani has given rise to a number of rumors one of which — that ISIS militants are afraid of being killed by women soldiers because if a woman kills a muhajid he will not go to Paradise — has become ingrained in the popular narrative about IS and the Kurds. However the source of the rumor was not an ISIS scholar but a female Kurdish fighter. Many of the news and magazine reports about the Kurdish women militias lauded these fighters as inspirational feminists. Yet are all female Kurdish fighters really a sign that the Kurdistan Workers Party or wider Kurdish society — is a bastion of feminism. The Marxist inspired PKK boasts one of the largest numbers of armed women militias in the world. According to the BBC women have been integral to the Kurdish movement since the PKKs founding in 1978. At that time it was strongly influenced by Marxist Leninist ideas. However the story of the PKKs all female militias is complex. The PKK was one way for Kurdish women to advance themselves. Wladimir van Wilgenburg a Middle East analyst with the Jamestown Foundation specializing in Kurdish politics says the hype over feminist Kurdish female militias is part of sensationalist reporting. There is a feminist tradition with the Kurdistan Workers Party based on the ideology of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan. it is not much different from other Marxist rebel movements that have female fighters but what makes it unique is that in general there are not a lot of political movements having female fighters. Especially not the Islamist ones van Wilgenburg told RFERL. In an op ed in Turkeys Hurriyet News Berfu Kiziltan of the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva offers an even less rosy picture of the PKK. According to Kiziltan while the PKK has historically recruited womenas well as men some of the recruitment has been by force. More than half of the PKKs suicide attacks in Turkey have been carried out by women because it was easier for them to evade security and because suicide bombings allowed women a way to prove they could be as fierce as their male counterparts she writes. At least one Kurdish female fighter has also carried out suicide bombings in Kobani. Earlier this month Kurdish fighter Arin Mirkan reportedly killed 10 IS militants when she blew herself up outside the northern Syrian town the first report of a Kurdish female fighter carrying out a suicide attack in Syria.

1449,The Islamic State is attempting to sell the body of dead US hostage James Foley for 1 million multiple sources told BuzzFeed in a report published Wednesday night. The unidentified sources described by BuzzFeed as middlemen with ties to the terror group said the Islamic State is looking for the money in exchange for Foleys remains. Foley was beheaded by the terror group earlier this year. A video titled A Message to America was posted online in mid August showing the photojournalist being killed by a militant. In this photo taken Oct 28 2014 two Jordanian men walk past graffiti depicting the flag of the Islamic State group with Arabic that reads There is only one God and Muhammad is his prophet in the city of Maan Jordan. One of the sources said he was approached by an Islamic State leader who asked him to work on a possible deal with either the US government or Foleys family. They ask for 1 million and they will send DNA to Turkey but they want the money first he told BuzzFeed. They will not give the DNA without the money. The middleman added that he was motivated by a desire to help provide closure to Foleys family and described his work as a humanity case. A representative for the State Department told BuzzFeed they are seeking more information on the report. A senior US diplomat added that the idea if true is disgusting. — Follow Oliver Darcy on Twitter
436,The Supreme Leader has been out of action for three weeks making his last appearance in public on September 3. And now people are asking whether his unhealthy obsession with Emmental cheese is behind the secret condition. Mr Kim missed a session at North Koreas law making body the Supreme Peoples Assembly this week the first time he has been absent since taking power in 2011. He was last seen with a limp at Moranbong Band concert earlier this month with speculation that he had ballooned in size as a result of his unhealthy diet. South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that the 31 year old was suffering from gout along with hyperuricemia hyperlipidemia obesity diabetes and high blood pressure. They attributed his condition to a large amount of drinking and overeating relating it to his dangerously high consumption of cheese. Emmental or Swiss cheese is made up of 45 fat and large quantities of it can lead to a number of serious health issues. The leader is said to have gained a habit of munching on the unhealthy dairy product in recent years which may be a reason behind his disappearance. A Korean source said last week His intake has increased in recent years with the strain of being in power. Cho Myung Chul a former researcher at the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy said he probably eats much more than the average North Korean. He added North Koreans think being fat is good unlike South Koreans who want to be skinny. Rumours spread that his recent disappearance may have been linked to a sport injury or that he was just on holiday. And other say the leader may be intentionally gaining weight to look like bloated grandfather Kim Il sung who achieved cult status for his national reform in the 1980s. Mr Cho said There is a high possibility Jong Un intentionally gained weight to look like Kim Il sung
1443,The NHL is considering expanding by as many as four teams according to a pair of reports with Toronto and Quebec City in the mix to land new franchises. Howard Bloom of Sports Business News tweeted that the league will add four franchises by 2017 in Toronto Quebec City Las Vegas and Seattle. Bloom added that the NHL would take in 14 billion in expansion fees with the deals. Also on Tuesday Tony Gallagher of the Province based in Vancouver reported that an NHL team in Las Vegas is a done deal according to sources close to the situation. However French language TVA Sports reported that NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly denied the league is looking to expand. it is not in our plans TVA Sports quoted Daly as saying in French. There is absolutely nothing new on that. The NHL has not expanded since the Columbus Blue Jackets and the Minnesota Wild joined for the 2000 01 season. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman who has previously dismissed talk of expanding beyond the leagues 30 teams visited Seattle in May for an update on a proposed new arena. In July former NHL great Wayne Gretzkys agent denied a report that his client is among a group of investors looking to bring a team to the city. Toronto and Quebec City have long been considered candidates if the NHL decides to expand beyond the seven Canadian based clubs in operation. Quebec City has not had an NHL team since the Nordiques moved to Denver in 1995. Toronto of course is already home to the Maple Leafs but it is possible that Canadas most populous city could support a second team whether in the city proper or the surrounding suburbs. Markham Ont just north of Toronto has flirted with the idea of funding the construction of an NHL sized arena but those plans have stalled. Arid Las Vegas may seem like an odd place for a hockey team but the Twitter account attributed to Panthers goalie Roberto Luongo suggested a sizable home ice advantage could be enjoyed against weary visitors to Sin City. Gon na be unreal when Las Vegas goes undefeated at home every year tweeted strombone1

1520,Jabhat al Nusra and Isis leaders are reportedly meeting to co ordinate attacks Isis fighters are reportedly just one mile away from Baghdad as reports emerge of al Qaeda militants bolstering their ranks in Syria. According to the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East Isis was approaching the Iraqi capital on Monday morning. The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad a spokesperson said. They said it could never happen and now it almost has. Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to be here a very short while to know they can do very very little. Isis fighters were also battling Government forces in a key town 25 miles west of Baghdad Amiriyat al Fallujah. According to a BBC correspondent fighting had calmed by Monday afternoon but a standoff continued along the main road to nearby Fallujah which is under Isis control. The extremists had been advancing towards the capital but were held off by bombing and Iraqi ground forces. US air strikes overnight targeted other Isis positions in Anbar province the Pentagon said and in Syria four more oil fields controlled by militants near Raqqa were hit on Sunday. American officials called the attacks successful but the UK based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed mostly civilians were hit and a grain silo was destroyed. The news comes amid reports of an emerging alliance between Isis forces in Syria and Jabhat al Nusra also known as the Nusra Front. The group is the Syrian offshoot of al Qaeda and has been fighting against the Assad regime in the civil war. Despite months of clashes between its forces and Isis militants the two groups appear to be forming a loose coalition in parts of the country to fight increasing attacks by the US and its allies. Al Nusras official spokesperson Abu Firas al Suri threatened the coalition nations with retaliation on Saturday. These states have committed a horrible act that is going to put them on the list of jihadist targets throughout the world he said. This is not a war against al Nusra but a war against Islam. Al Nusra and Isis leaders are now holding war planning meetings together a source told the Guardian although no formal alliance has been confirmed. The reports follow growing defections from other Islamist groups to Isis which is seen as better organised and equipped to create an Islamic State straddling Iraq and Syria. A loyalty pledge was reportedly made by al Nusra in June in the town of Al Bukamal near the Iraqi border the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said and the two groups have fought together against Government forces. The report appeared to be confirmed on Twitter by a photograph showing an Egyptian al Nusra Front commander shaking hands with an Isis leader of Chechen origin. Although both Isis and al Nusra are rooted in al Qaeda the two have been rivals since Isis started its involvement in Syrias civil war in spring last year and have engaged in bloody battles killing more than 3000 militants from both sides. A merger had been declared by Isis leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi in 2013 when Isis was known as al Qaeda in Iraq but the alliance was rejected by al Nusra and overruled by al Qaeda leader al Zawahiri. But the international response to Isis bloody rampage through Iraq and Syria and the beheadings of British and American hostages is pushing the groups towards an alliance. An al Nusra source told Reuters There are hardline voices inside Nusra who are pushing for reconciliation with Islamic State. A formal alliance is believed to only be possible on the orders of al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri. A deal between the militant groups would strengthen the Islamist force in Syria as air strikes cripple Isis funding sources equipment stores and slow its advances. The US has not said al Nusra is being targeted but its planes have attacked a new group called Khorasan which some analysts suspect is part of al Nusra. The two groups have been known to co operate and Khorasan is believed to be made up of veteran al Qaeda fighters with battlefield experience mostly in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Britain the US and the United Nations are among those who have classed al Nusra as a terrorist group citing its use of suicide bombing terrorist attacks and attempts to impose Islamic law. A small number of anti Government groups including some members for the secular Free Syrian Army opposed the label after al Nusra gained respect fighting the Assad regime

2262,Raven Symoné took to Instagram to deny rumors that Bill Cosby molested her while she was on The Cosby Show. The rumor has been gaining steam for a few days now ever since a site called Hip Hop Hangover published a story claiming the actress was drugged and raped by Cosby and had filed charges against him. That site is a gossip parody and satirical publication and for entertainment purposes only. I have no idea who in the hell would consider a story about a young girl being drugged and raped entertainment but there you have the world of the Internet folks. Snopes debunked this rumor awhile ago but just in case people still need more proof Raven Symoné posted her own response to this on her Instagram page today I was NOT taking advantage of by Mr Cosby when I was on the Cosby Show. I was practically a baby on that show and this is truly a disgusting rumor that I want no part of. Everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness. Now keep me out of this. I am sorry that she even has to do this. Sites like this are not parody or satire sites OK. They exist strictly to farm clicks by posting fake stories and deliberately manipulate people.

250,Michael Foley says the administration threatened him when the family tried to raise funds that is what really bothers me to the core he said The government says paying ransom to terrorists only fuels more abductions but denied threatening the Foley family The brother of James Foley said on Thursday that the Obama administration threatened him when he tried to raise funds for the slain journalists release from the terrorist group that beheaded him. They were actually an impedance Foley told Fox News referring to the governments role in rescuing his older brother a photojournalist who was kidnapped by ISIS militants in Northern Syria in 2012. They got in our way that is what really bothers me to the core. The US follows a strict policy of never negotiating with terrorist organizations or paying ransom for Americans kidnapped by them arguing doing so only leads to more abductions. Scroll down for video James Foleys parents John and Diane Foley and his brother Michael speak to reporters about James murder outside of their home in Rochester New Hampshire last month. Michael has become particularly outspoken about the failures of the Obama administration to rescue his brother and for threatening the family for trying to raise funds to secure his release Captured and executed James Foley was taken hostage on Thanksgiving 2012 while working for GlobalPost in northern Syria and executed video of the brutal act was released online on August 19 We have found that terrorist organizations use hostage taking and ransoms as a critical source of financing for their organization and that paying ransoms only puts other Americans in a position where they are at even greater risk White House spokesman John Earnest said. Foley however said the government made it difficult for the family to privately raise funds to secure his brothers freedom. I was specifically threatened by the Department of State about raising funds towards ransom demands for my brother he said. We were smart enough to look past it but it slowed us down. We lost a lot of time. US freelance reporter James Foley was kidnapped in war torn Syria in November 2012 and executed by his ISIS captors in a video posted online on August 19 of this year Michael Foley at right and other members of his family tried desperately to raise funds to secure James release from the hands of his captors In a separate interview with ABC News his mother Diane Foley said a military officer working for the National Security Council told them several times that her family could face criminal charges if they paid a ransom. We took it as a threat and it was appalling she said. Three times he intimidated us with that message. We were horrified he would say that. He just told us we would be prosecuted. We knew we had to save our son we had to try A spokeswoman for the National Security Council said that the Foley family was informed of US laws banning terrorism financing but denied members were told they could face charges if they made a ransom payment according to ABC. Michael Foley also said in the interview the new military campaign the US is pursuing to stop ISIS came too late for Jim. Devastated Diane and John Foley talk to reporters on Wednesday August 20 2014 outside their home in Rochester New Hampshire. The day before shocking footage of their sons execution was posted online Strategy President Barack Obama addresses the nation from the Cross Hall in the White House in Washington on Wednesday and said he had authorized US airstrikes inside Syria for the first time along with expanded strikes in Iraq as part of a steady relentless effort to root out Islamic State extremists I just hope it is not too late for others he said. ISIS is still holding several hostages from Western and other countries. Diane Foley earlier spoke of her deep disappointment she felt towards the Obama administration for its handling of his time as a prisoner of the terror group saying I really feel our country let Jim down. On the 13th anniversary of 911 and the day after President Obama addressed the nation and finally offered a strategy to defeat ISIS Foley told CNN that as an American she was embarrassed and appalled at the efforts to rescue her son from captivity. Articulate and thoughtful throughout her interview she made the startling claim that US officials threatened her family with prosecution if they tried to raise a ransom for Foley 40 and said Jim was sacrificed because of a lack of communication and prioritization. And in a thinly veiled attack on Obamas new strategy to degrade and destroy ISIS she said that meeting violence with more violence may not be the answer and said bombing caused Jims death. Jim was killed in the most horrific way. He was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination lack of communication lack of prioritization Foley said. As a family we had to find our way through this on our own. Still grieving Diane Foley also said US officials told her they would not exchange prisoners or carry out any military action to try and rescue her son. At times withering in her assessment of the Obama administrations co ordination with her family Mrs Foley poured scorn on the Pentagons claim they tried to rescue Foley on July 4 only to raid the wrong base. Speaking to CNNs Anderson Cooper Foley said her family knew where James Foley was being held on two separate occasions in Syria and that each time he was there for months following his capture on Thanksgiving 2012. On August 19 ISIS released a gruesome video online which showed the beheading of Foley by a masked ISIS militant who told the camera in a British accent that his real killer was the United States. Exactly two weeks later another American journalist Stephen Sotloff was beheaded apparently by the same man who tells the camera I am back Obama. During the efforts to get James home Mrs Foley said she met good people people who wanted to help but was adamant that she did not want to single anyone out and lay blame. Mrs Foley said it was important to remember that ISIS is the enemy and not the United States. However ultimately she did not feel that Jim was a priority. We were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow miraculously said Foleys mother to CNN. And he was not was he.

66,THE Islamic State may be harvesting the organs of victims to finance its terror operations Iraqs ambassador to the United Nations says. Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim said today that in the past few weeks bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys or other body parts have been found in shallow mass graves. We have bodies. Come and examine them he said referring to the UN Security Council. It is clear they are missing certain parts. HORROR ISIS fanatics hurl public execution victims into deep ravine in Syria HOSTAGE Kayla Muellers boyfriend tried to save her from ISIS Ambassador Alhakim also said a dozen doctors had been executed in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting before briefing the council on the situation in Iraq in which he accused ISIS of committing crimes of genocide in targeting certain ethnic groups. The outgoing UN envoy to Iraq Nikolay Mladenov told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict. Mr Mladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that the Islamic State group is using organ harvesting as a financing method but he said only that it is very clear that the tactics ISIS is using expand by the day. He said Iraqs most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that the Islamic State group has seized in the past year including a third of both Iraq and neighbouring Syria where the Sunni militants have imposed strict Sharia law. Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control Mr Mladenov said. ISIS had recently confirmed the death of American aid worker and ISIS hostage Kayla Mueller who was kidnapped by the militant group in 2013 during what should have been a 10 minute trip to the bus station in Syria. Ms Mueller her boyfriend at the time Alkhani the taxi driver and a fourth person were ambushed and forced out of the vehicle at gunpoint and threatened with death. Mueller remained a hostage while Alkhani was released a couple of months later after being beaten and interrogated about his work as a photographer his religion and his relationship to Mueller. The terror group has also recently antagonised Egypt after releasing a video showing the beheading of 21 Egyptian Christians. Egypt retaliated by bombing ISIS targets in Libya

1207,The Islamic State is harvesting organs of its victims to finance its terrorist army the Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations said Tuesday. We have bodies. Come and examine them said Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim referring to the UN Security Council. It is clear they are missing certain parts. Here is how he described bodies as missing kidneys and showing marks of surgical incisions When we discover mass graves we look at the bodies. Some of those bodies are killed by bullets some of them by knives. But when you find pieces of the back is sic missing and the kidneys is sic missing you will wonder what it is. His report reveals that the ISIS never fails to shock the world. He declared that the ISIS executed a dozen doctors in Mosul because they refused to cooperate to remove organs. Alhakim is replacing outgoing ambassador Nikolay Mladenov who told the Security Council it is very clear that the tactics ISIS is using expand by the day. The ISIS controls territory that includes the airports in Mosul in Iraq and Aleppo in Syria giving it the ability to ship human organs to traffickers. He said IS has access to airports in Mosul and in the Syrian city of Aleppo from which it could transport the illicit organs to international middlemen and buyers. No less shocking is that the Western world is treating the report as if it did not know months ago that the Islamic State has resorted to harvesting human organs. Al Monitor reported last December 5 The third funding source besides oil sales and taxes on residents was exposed by otolaryngologist Siruwan al Mosuli. He said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul. Arab and foreign surgeons were hired but prohibited from mixing with local doctors. Information then leaked about organ selling. Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped. The Western world not least of all the Obama administration chose not to disseminate the information in hopes of postponing the inevitable – a declaration of war on the ISIS. Valuable time has been lost by imagining that the Islamic State is the problem of Iraq and Syria and not of the entire world
1643,Hewlett Packard CEO Meg Whitman reportedly plans to split the company in two becoming chair of a new company with its PC and printer business and CEO of a new company with its corporate hardware and services businesses. Hewlett Packard plans to break into two companies in a move that would create separate personal computerprinter and corporate hardwareservices businesses the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. The report cited unnamed sources who said the plan could be announced as early as Monday. The split would be done as a tax free distribution of stock to shareholders next year one of the Journals sources said. It would be the second big breakup of a Silicon Valley tech powerhouse in a week following eBays plan to spin off PayPal. It also comes in the wake of Oracles announcement that Larry Ellison was handing the CEO reins over to former HP CEO Mark Hurd and Safra Catz. The move by HP has long been speculated upon and follows the 2011 exploration of a spinoff of the PC business during Leo Apothekers stormy and short tenure as CEO. Current CEO Meg Whitman reorganized the company to combine the PC and printer units which are leaders in shrinking businesses. HP was No. 1 in PCs until last year when it slipped behind Chinas Lenovo Group Ltd. The Journal said that Whitman will be chairman of the PC and printer business and CEO of the other enterprise focused business. Lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company. Dion Weisler an executive in the PC and printer operation will be CEO of that business. HP brought in 559 billion in revenue from its printing and personal systems group last year about half of its total. But sales dropped by about 71 percent in the unit compared to a 67 percent drop for the company as a whole
2436,Gone are the days when Jason Alexander danced on the streets to celebrate McDonalds McDLT and SO WE THOUGHT gone are the days when the McPizza was hawked to awed fast food patrons. Because as it turns out there are still two McDonalds locations selling the long since discontinued Italian ish treat. So maybe there is still hope for Jason Alexander. it is not quite public knowledge how the two locations still have access to the McPizza an employee at the West Virginia location has said that it is the same pizza as they sold when she started there 11 years ago and it is presumably the same that children everywhere enjoyed throughout the 1990s according to Canadacom. Fans of the five minute meal need only travel to one of the two tiny border towns to indulge their decades old craving. Just know that if you do go you are most likely diminishing a stockpile of nostalgic food that might not ever be replenished. Adam Lapetina is a FoodDrink staff writer for Thrillist and despite being born during its heyday has never eaten a McPizza. Read his musings at adamlapetina
2547,Saturated fat has been a controversial subject in recent years with some research suggesting that it may not be as bad for health as once thought. But a new study published in The BMJ dashes any hope that butter is actually back. Cutting down on saturated fatty acids—found in animal foods like dairy and meat as well as palm and coconut oil—may lower risk of coronary heart disease according to researchers. And swapping these foods for unsaturated fats whole grains and plant based proteins seems to boost heart health even further. The new findings are significant because saturated fat has been a source of debate Studies have shown that saturated fatty acids can affect cholesterol but there is has not been any definitive research linking them to overall heart health. A large meta analysis published this summer for example found that butter consumption does not appear to raise heart disease risk. The current US Dietary Guidelines have taken a conservative approach to saturated fats saying they should make up no more than 10 of total calories. Qi Sun MD assistant professor of nutrition in the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health and senior author of the new study says his groups findings back up this advice. RELATED 13 Healthy High Fat Foods You Should Eat The new study also bolsters government recommendations for eating an overall healthful diet Dr Sun told Health—one that includes fruits vegetables whole grains vegetable cooking oils rich in polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats nuts legumes fish and low fat dairy. To determine saturated fats long term effects on heart health he and his colleagues followed more than 73000 women and 42000 men for an average of 26 years collecting data on their diet and health every four years. After controlling for factors such as age ethnicity and other potential influencers the researchers found that participants who consumed the most calories from four commonly consumed saturated fatty acids—lauric acid myristic acid plametic acid and stearic acid—were 18 more likely to develop coronary heart disease over the course of the study than those who consumed the least. Some researchers have suggested putting individual limits on each of these fatty acids said co author Frank Hu PhD professor of nutrition and epidemiology in a press release. But that is not practical he argues since they share many of the same food sources red meat dairy fat butter lard and palm oil. RELATED Good Fats Bat Fats How to Choose Instead it is healthier to focus on lowering total saturated fat intake says Hu. In fact the researchers estimated that replacing just 1 of those fats with the same number of calories from poly or monounsaturated fats whole grains or plant based proteins could reduce heart disease risk by 4 to 8. The study specifically recommends swapping animal fats with vegetable oils high in unsaturated fat and points out that restaurant food and snacks and bakery items—including crackers chips popcorn cakes and cookies—can be high in saturated fat. The researchers also offer some insight as to why prior studies have not always shown a clear link between less saturated fat intake and better heart health. Often the authors say people who cut back on saturated fat replace those calories with low quality carbs like processed food and refined flour. These are associated with health risks of their own and likely cancel out any health benefits. RELATED The 22 Worst Foods for Trans Fat This is the largest observational study to date to examine the association between specific saturated fatty acids and the risk of coronary heart disease say the authors and its results are in line with previous research that has focused specifically on healthy swaps. While the findings are not terribly surprising they do serve one important purpose As Hu put it this study dispels the notion that butter is back
1030,BUTTE — Butte Police Commissioner Bartholomew S Harrington is a wanted man in these parts. Too bad neither the position nor the man exist. A satirical story about Rob ONeill posted on the Internet has prompted everyone from Associated Press reporters to Louisiana law enforcement officers to call local authorities for information. Empire News posted a bogus article Monday titled Bin Laden Shooter Rob ONeill Mistakenly Attacked by Street Thugs Seeking To Collect Debt From Neighbor. Nothing in the story has a resemblance of truth Butte Silver Bow Undersheriff George Skuletich said Wednesday. Skuletich does exist for the record. What is fabricated in the article includes the police commissioner five gang members seeking a drug debt and the Butte Daily Times. Also ONeill did not take down the intruders and brew a pot of coffee while awaiting backup. we have been getting all kinds of calls from across the country Sheriff Ed Lester said. The article has been making its rounds on social media sites. This prompted Snopescom to label it false. Empire News is one of many fake news sites responsible for the frequent hoodwinking of Facebook users. Among previous hoaxes were a yarn about welfare recipients getting free cars a claim that Colorado legalized meth and a widely shared story about pending snowmageddon Snopes notes. The piece claims that members of the Crips gang broke into the home of the former Navy SEAL and Butte native. We do not have established Bloods or Crips here Lester added. The story goes As the five thugs ran aimlessly through the home Mr ONeill used silent hand to hand combat tactics to individually disarm them of their weapons. Once Mr ONeill had taken down the five men and secured his home he brewed a pot of coffee and called the police station. Those boys sure did find the wrong house. While some might find the fake news piece amusing local police are reminded of another hoax of a girl who reportedly shot intruders An 11 year old Butte girl was reported to have taken out two crooks. She was reportedly a clay shooting champion in Butte who killed one man with a shot to the genitals and the other bled out. That bogus story reappears about every year or so Lester said
1128,A WOMAN has spent 20000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity. The Florida massage therapist who calls herself Jasmine Tridevil said she had the surgery a few months ago. It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they are breaking the code of ethics Tridevil told Real Radio 1041. I called like 50 or 60 doctors nobody wanted to do it. Last month she posted a YouTube video of herself in a bikini while Radioheads Creep plays in the background. Tridevil said her extra breast felt like her other breasts the only difference is the nipple which she had to get tattooed on. The 21 year old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around. My whole dream is to get this show on MTV she said. I am dumping every penny I have into this. If this does not work I am through. Tridevil said that while she wanted fame and fortune this was not why she had the surgery. I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I do not want to date anymore she said. She has been filmed telling her parents about the third boob and they were not happy. My mum ran out the door. She will not talk to me. She will not let my sister talk to me. My dad he really is not happy he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it she said. While some have criticised Tridevil for her chasing fame others have described her as beautiful and commented that she reminds them of the girl in the sci fi film Total Recall. I love boobs you have three what is not to like we all loved that girl in Total Recall now your the real deal said one follower on her Facebook page.

1527,TechCrunch reports that Apple plans to shut down Beats Music the streaming music service that it acquired earlier this year. The blogs Josh Constine says that he is confirmed the news with five sources at both Apple and Beats. And to be honest it makes sense. It seems very unlikely that Apple is going to abandon streaming music altogether. If true news that Beats Music is dying reads as a clear indication that Apple is going to create its own streaming service or simply expand iTunes Radio. Constine agrees Considering Apples penchant for simple unified brands and how it despises fragmentation shutting down Beats Music makes a lot of sense. Running a second music service in parallel with iTunes that forces people to learn a whole new interface might have confused customers. Beats Musics CEO Ian Rogers was also put in charge of iTunes Radio meaning he is already splitting his time rather than just focusing on Beats Music. Based on images of the home screen Constine adds it looks like Apples readying a new music app just for the new Apple Watch. People thought the companys music app for wearables would be Beats Music. And maybe it sort of is on the back end. It just will not be called Beats Music. Read the full report at TechCrunch
2285,—Three Afghan soldiers in Massachusetts for training who went missing were found trying to cross the border into Canada several media outlets reported Monday. The soldiers told customs agents they were refugees and were trying to cross the Niagara Falls Rainbow Bridge WCVB reported. The troops were reported missing after a trip to a shopping mall late Saturday authorities said. It was the second time in a week that Afghan security trainees in the United States have disappeared. Earlier this month two Afghan police officers training with the DEA wandered off during a sightseeing trip to Georgetown CNN affiliate WJLA reported. They decided they wanted to stay in the United States but authorities found them and sent them home. The three men who went missing in Massachusetts were identified as Afghanistan National Army Soldiers Maj Jan Mohammad Arash Cpt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Cpt. Noorullah Aminyar. They arrived in the United States on Sept11 for Exercise Regional Cooperation an annual event the guard said and were quartered at Joint Base Cape Cod. Troops from six nations are participating in the exercise which runs through Wednesday and will go on as scheduled the guard said. Roughly a dozen Afghan soldiers are still participating

2488,Apple has opted to delay production on the rumored larger screened iPad Pro due to issues with display panel supply reports Bloomberg. Manufacturing on the tablet will reportedly begin in September rather than earlier in the yearProduction of the 129 inch screen iPad is now scheduled to start around September because of delays involving the supply of display panels said one of the people who asked not to be identified because the details are not public. Apple had initially planned to begin making the larger version this quarter people familiar those plans had saidThis is not the first time that rumors have hinted at delays for the iPad Pro. Apple was said to be targeting an early 2015 release date for the tablet last year but those plans were reportedly put on hold. Back in October The Wall Street Journal said that Apple had opted to delay mass production on the iPad in order to focus on iPhone 6 Plus production and in November KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo said production could be delayed until Q2 2015 because of difficulties related to the production of display components. With production delayed until September the tablet could see a release in late 2015. Rendering of the iPad Pro by Martin Hajek Apple is planning to use the iPad Pro as the media calls it to boost its flagging iPad sales. The tablet is expected to measure in somewhere between 122 and 129 inches dwarfing both the 97 inch iPad Air 2 and the 79 inch iPad mini 3. It may be targeted at the enterprise market and rumors have suggested it could sport an ultra high resolution display and stereo speakers at the top and bottom edges of the device for an improved audio experience. It may also ship with an optional stylus accessory. Related roundup iPad Pro Tag bloombergcom

647,With Apple Watchs launch day edging ever closer the company is reportedly preparing to make some changes at its global chain of stores in order to accommodate the most expensive version of its new smartwatch. The tech company is said to be bringing tailor made safes to its retail locations for the secure overnight storage of its gold Apple Watches a move that it hopes will help deter nefarious types from considering a late night shopping expedition of the smash n grab variety. The specially designed safes will hold demo devices as well as on sale stock and come equipped with MagSafe chargers so the demo units can begin each day fully charged a source told 9to5Mac. Related Apples watch changes everything. Or does it. The smartwatch model set for the special treatment – the Apple Watch Edition – incorporates a case crafted from 18 karat gold that Apple claims has been specially developed to be up to twice as hard as standard gold. It also features a display protected by polished sapphire crystal. While it is rare for Apple Stores to get hit by raids it has been known to happen. With a new and expensive product about to arrive it could make the stores more of a target so it is little surprise that the company is reportedly taking special measures to deter criminals. The exact price of this particular version of Apples smartwatch is yet to be announced though considering its premium materials as well as the fact that the Cupertino company is acting to safeguard units outside of regular trading hours it is fair to assume that customers who go for the Edition will be laying down several thousand dollars at the least. Related New Apple Watch details leak via companion app Speaking recently during a call with investors following Apples reporting of record breaking quarterly earnings CEO Tim Cook said its wrist based computer should be arriving in stores in April. A survey toward the end of last year suggested one in ten people with an iPhone would be very likely to buy an Apple Watch over the next 12 months though it is easy to imagine that figure will increase as the company ramps up its marketing efforts nearer to launch time

2136,nce War The Islamic State is harvesting human organs to finance its blood driven caliphate according to Iraqs ambassador to the United Nations urging its Security Council to investigate the issue. Envoy Mohamed Alhakim called on the 15 member body to look at allegations of organ removal by the Islamic State as bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys were discovered in shallow mass graves. We have bodies. Come and examine them the envoy Mohamed Alhakim said on Tuesday. It is clear they are missing certain parts the diplomat also noted adding that a dozen doctors were executed in in northern Iraq after allegedly refusing to harvest organs of the ISIS victims. The Islamic State is guilty of crimes of genocide of ethnic groups Alhakim said. These terrorist groups have desecrated all human values. They have committed the most heinous criminal terrorist acts against the Iraqi people whether Shiite Sunni Christians Turkmen Shabak or Yazidis Iraqs UN Ambassador said. After the testimony the UN envoy to Iraq Nikolay Mladenov then briefed the Council saying that there are numerous reports to support the claim of organ harvesting which the envoy says is done by the caliphate to finance its cause. it is very clear that the tactics ISIS is using expand by the day Mladenov said. Almost daily terrorist attacks continue to deliberately target all Iraqis most notably the Shiite community as well as ethnic and religious minorities across the country he told the Security Council specifying that at least 790 people were killed in January in Iraq. Equally worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from control he said. Looking into the source of ISIS funding Middle East media outlet Al Monitor claimed that foreign doctors were harvesting organs in Mosul in a report last year based on a medical source. According to the Iraqi doctor providing the information otolaryngologist Siruwan al Mosuli there had been an unusual movement in clinics in Mosul where Arab and foreign surgeons were hired but prohibited from mixing with local doctors. The organs al Mosuli told Al Monitor were coming from kidnapped individuals or wounded fighters. Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs the doctor claimed accusing specialized mafia of being involved internationally. Organ harvesting news comes as the Islamic State jihadists burnt 45 people alive near the town al Baghdadi in Western Iraq. It also comes in the footsteps of the recent beheading of 21 Coptic Christians in Libya and the brutal execution of a Jordanian pilot
128,UPDATE Sod Crabzilla Now Budapest Is Under Attack From A Furious Giant Behold – there is a ocean dwelling beast lurking off the shore of Whitstable. Yes the sleepy seaside town famed for its oysters and cream teas is now apparently home to a giant sea monster which has rightly earned the moniker Crabzilla. A satellite image of the colossal crustacean – thought to be 50ft across surfaced on Weird Whitstable an online journal dedicated to tall tales in the area. Could it be. Blog curator Quinton Winter revealed to The Express he had encountered the decapod himself At first all I could see was some faint movement then as it rose from the water I thought that is a funny looking bit of driftwood. It had glazed blank eyes on stalks swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws. Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd shaped sandbank. Now I know better. Winter first made reference to the giant crab in July last year when he published a wholly unconvincing image of an oversized shellfish poking its claws out of the water below two blissfully unaware children playing on the pier. It was accompanied with the explanation This shocking image of a giant crab under a popular crabbing spot in Whitstable was taken last weekend. The boys were unaware of the danger but as several passerbys shouted to them the crab silently slipped away under the water into the dark sideways. According to the Marine Biological Association of the UK the biggest crab in the world is the Japanese Spider Crab which can grow up to 37m across. Crabzilla however appears to be shaped like an edible crab commonly found in British waters and growing up to 5 inches in width. Graphic artist Ashley Austen told Kent Online The image of the giant crab can be quite easily recreated in Photoshop. All the artist had to do is find a suitable image of a crab overlay it onto the satellite picture of the harbour and apply a few filters to get the realistic look. You do not say

287,BOUCHERVILLE Que. Gary Bettman has vehemently denied the NHL is considering expansion. But the commissioner said if it ever does prospective owners may have to pay up big time. Sports Business News reported via Twitter last week the NHL will expand into Las Vegas Seattle and Quebec City while adding a second franchise in Toronto by 2017. On Wednesday Bettman called the report a complete fabrication and took issue with the franchise fees cited in the story — US 14 billion or 350 million per team. The part of the story that I found particularly difficult is suggesting that we would sell four franchises for 14 billion is way too low Bettman said. It undervalues our franchises. The last two expansion teams the Minnesota Wild and the Columbus Blue Jackets paid 80 million each in expansion fees in 2000 but league revenues have soared since then. Bettman said the league is not looking to expand or relocate any franchises. He added that no teams were looking to move including the struggling Florida Panthers — even if their new owner has concerns about the clubs arena lease. Nobodys moving said Bettman. And speculation to the contrary not only is wrong it is unfair to the team and their fans who are being speculated about. Our franchises have never been healthier. Our league in terms of its economic footing has never been healthier. He made the remarks at an event put on by a media company Quebecor that hopes to bring NHL hockey back to Quebec City. NHL coffers were fattened by a 12 year deal worth 52 billion with Rogers which will begin broadcasting games this season on Sportsnet. Quebecor reportedly will pay Rogers a total of 15 billion over 12 years for the French language portion of the broadcast rights with games aired mainly on TVA Sports. Quebecor bought naming rights on a 400 million arena due to be completed by fall 2015 in Quebec City which hopes to land an NHL club. Bettman attended TVA Sports hockey launch at a suburban restaurant along with former prime minister Brian Mulroney who is chairman of Quebecor Montreal Canadiens owner Geoff Molson Quebec Major Junior Hockey League president Gilles Courteau and other league and company officials. However Bettman had no encouraging words for those looking to revive the Quebec Nordiques who left in 1994 to become the Colorado Avalanche. We do not want to build up anybodys expectations he said. we are not in a position to expand. we are certainly not in position to expand into the East. we have been very candid and up front that if in fact we go through an expansion process the world will know about it. But we are not looking to relocate any franchises and we are not looking to expand. we have been very clear about that since Day One when we were told about the building of the new arena. Still rumours that the league is at least considering adding teams have been circulating. A report from Vancouver last week said a team in Las Vegas was a done deal. Bettman said there is plenty of interest from people wanting NHL expansion teams but added the league has not even begun to research the issue. In June Bettman said that if there were enough expansion candidates the leagues board of governors may well invoke a formal expansion process and we will look at everything. Mulroney had no comment on Quebec Citys expansion prospects. During the news conference the former Conservative prime minister joked that he was a right winger when he played as a boy in Baie Comeau Que and told a story about how his father discouraged him from trying to become a pro player because there was no money in hockey. If he was alive today I had take him by the hand and say Let me introduce you to PK. Subban he said. The Montreal Canadiens defenceman signed a 72 million eight year contract on Aug 2. Bettman said the league is close to naming a successor to Brendan Shanahan as disciplinarian and head of player safety. Shanahan stepped down in April and was replaced on an interim basis by Stephane Quintal. we are getting to the short strokes of that process said Bettman. we have interviewed a lot of candidates including somebody who is been doing it on an interim basis and we will be making a decision shortly. We wanted to finish the process. By the start of the season we will have an announcement

1316,According to TimesLivecom a 17 year old woman has allegedly damaged her 25 year old boyfriends penis after a sex tape of the two of them was released. The woman who is unnamed because she is underage is said to have poured a bottle of acid onto Humphrey Khozas penis while he was out watching a soccer game with his friends in Mpumalanga South Africa. Everything happened in a blink of an eye because I saw her when she was coming with a bottle but I did not realize that she was carrying acid. She just angrily called me a dog. She asked how in the world I could have done such an evil thing to her. It was only then that I realized that she was talking about the video that I took while we were having sex Khoza reportedly said. Khoza is sticking with the story that he never planned to release the video of him and his girlfriend of less than two months and that he has no idea how it ended up on the Internet in the first place which is all well and good except now he can not use his penis. He reportedly must now pee from a tube and undergo surgery. Still Khoza will not press charges Even if I press charges it is useless because it will not bring back my manhood Khoza said. Her being in jail will just ruin her future because she is still young and I do not have the energy to attend courts. To each his own

1626,The melodic warbling of Justin Bieber is credited with saving a mans life in Europe. Igor Vorozhbitsyn told the Austrian Times he was fishing in northern Russias Yakutia Republic when a bear attacked him. The man thought he was done for but when the bear clawed at him his cellphone went off. The ringtone Justin Biebers Baby caused the bear to run away. Wildlife experts believe the ringtone according to local media the singers hit Baby must have startled the bear into halting its attack. Sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear explained one. Igor suffered from cuts and severe bruises to his face and chest and was rescued when he was found by other fishermen after using the phone to call for help. The bears actions are completely understandable. Who among us has not ran screeching in a state of panic from the room when Biebers Baby is played. I often use Baby to scare away annoying door to door salesman or pesky types like my landlord with her annoying questions about why I have not paid my rent or what the smell coming from my apartment is. I hear the Pentagon is currently experimenting with using the song in place of a missile defensive system for the United States. Bieber could save this country billions in national defense. Vorozhbitsyn said his granddaughter put the ringtone on his phone as a joke. it is OK dude. You can admit to being a Belieber. We will not judge you

697,If you have been anywhere even remotely near a computer today you have probably heard that Argentinas president recently adopted a young Jewish man to stop him from turning into a werewolf. And why not—it is internet gold. Also as it turns out not even remotely true. According to the Washington Post the story of the day is as follows A tradition holds that the seventh son of a family is doomed to turn into a werewolf — known as el lobison in Argentina — after his 13th birthday and will stalk the night in its beastly form feeding on the dead and murdering all before it. The fear of this werewolf child was so pronounced that many seventh sons were killed after they were born which started the practice in 1907 of Argentine leaders taking these children symbolically under their wing. While yes seventh sons and daughters in Argentina are eligible to become the godson or goddaughter of the countrys president as The Guardian points out Jewish werewolf hood has no part in the tradition. Which is fairly evident from Argentinian President Cristina Fernández de Kirchners tweets depicting the countrys newly announced first Jewish godson. Top translation They brought me a menorah. They asked me to light it. Bottom translation I did not realize it but their visit coincided with Hanukkah. But as The Guardian points out this nice totally innocuous event somehow got mixed up with an ancient werewolf esque myth called the lobizón But somehow the story became entangled with the ancient legend of the lobizón. According to some versions of the myth the seventh son of the seventh son is particularly prone to fall victim to the curse. Evidently the chance meeting of a Latin American president with a colorful myth too good to fact check proved irresistible – confirming as it did any number of stereotypes about erratic behavior from national leaders in the continent of magical realism. In fact the only connection between the two tales is that they center around seventh children. There is an actual century old tradition in which every seventh child born to an Argentinian family is eligible to become the presidents godchild—a practice originating from Czarist Russia. The tale of the lobizón on the other hand started amongst Argentinas gauchos and has nothing whatsoever to do with the presidents newly minted godson. So sorry to burst your bubble internet—no werewolf Jewish godsons this time. But hey at least it got us talking about this again.

2298,The National Security Council says it is appalled by the apparent beheading of journalist Steven Sotloff by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of US citizen Steven Sotloff by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant NSC spokesperson Bernadette Meehan said in a statement. The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends.

According to the monitoring service SITE Intelligence Group Sotloff was beheaded in the same manner as James Foley the photojournalist who was killed last month. The executioner is reportedly the same man who killed Foley and threatened to kill Sotloff in the video released on Aug 19.

2074,This letter from a little girl in support of her gay teacher might bring a tear to your eye A 9 year old girl gave this heartfelt letter to her teacher after he came out as gay http tco8ZErlBCfuS pictwittercomJFfIRBnX4P— PinkNews December 15 2014 This letter of support was given to a primary school teacher by a 9 year old girl after he came out as gay to his class. The teacher known as Mr R decided to come out to his class after learning that the pupils felt there was something wrong or bad about gay and lesbian people. The full letter reads Dear Mr R Even though you are gay I will always treat you the same way as I do now. I still think about you the same way as I used to. you are a great teacher and these are just some of the words that I would describe you as great amazing fantastic brilliant awesome and brave. The reason why I say brave is because you shared a personal secret which was very brave. You do not have to feel scared because I know that everyone in the class feels the same way as I do. From A x x PS. We are all proud of you The teacher and school have not been revealed but the teacher gave an interview to Pink News. He told the website he decided to come out to his class after he learned a worrying fact during anti bullying week As part of anti bullying week I had asked whod heard gay being used as an insult. Almost every one of my class put their hands up. I was stunned. Then I asked who thought that people who were gay or lesbian were bad or wrong in some way again almost every hand went up. He said he felt very moved by the letter and that it bought a tear to his eye. Reading it brought tears to my eyes and it took me a little while to compose myself. When I thanked her she just shrugged and repeated something one of the boys in the class had said during the lesson it is just your life. Then she went back to her maths. For my class it was a surprise sure but to them it was just something simple and easy to file away as another piece of information. There was no judgement no follow up just acceptance. Now I can mention my fiancé as easily as any other teacher and my class know me a little better. I have had a lot of letters and cards over the years but this one I know I will keep forever

929,– In the boldest takeover of Presidential authority in history Barack Obama ordered the Federal Reserve to adopt the euro beginning October 1 2015 the start of the next fiscal year. The US will soon share the single monetary system used by 18 European Union member states including Greece France Germany and Slovakia. The surprise announcement resulted from secret overseas deals between Obama foreign finance ministers and the Federal Reserve System. This step forward announced Obama will make it easier for Americans and Wall Street to compare prices stabilize the economy and set us up to again become leaders on the world economic stage. The President revealed the changeover during the worldwide economic summit held in Beijing where alongside Chinese premier Li Keqiang he worked out a climate accord agreement also developed in secrecy. Criticism has been swift and severe. Obamas given up entirely on our US economy after single handedly destroying it said Rep Kevin Brady Chairman of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee. it is like breaking all the toys in the toybox and then saying I do not want to play with those broken products anymore said former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. This is the most abusive power grab witnessed on the worldwide stage. He needs to consider staying over in China while he is there she added. To help with the conversion to the euro a new whitehousegov website will launch in early 2015 complete with downloadable conversion calculators and apps. Printable vouchers will be provided for discounts toward government manufactured cash registers. A childrens website featuring Yuri the Happy Euro will help prepare youngsters for the new system. For the first 3 months of the conversion euro notes and coins will circulate jointly with US currency owing to overlap with the 2015 holiday season. We do not want to add any extra stress to an already hectic time of year said the President. My economic team predicts everything will go smoothly and holiday shopping should be stronger than ever. Many unanswered questions remain. Will vendors take advantage of the new system to gouge consumers. What about ATMs. Will small businesses who can not afford to make the changeover right away close up shop and further weaken an increasingly unstable Obama economy. I think it is a good idea said Washington DC shop owner Vonda Miller. I spend too much time counting pennies all day long making change. They tell me my taxes will be easier to do so I am for whatever the President wants. National Report will keep readers informed with updates about the anticipated massive fallout over this latest political bombshell occurring during the last days of Obamas increasingly emboldened administration

Snopescom came up with a number of intriguing arguments that could indicate Jasmine Tridevil did not actually pay 20000 for an extra breast. It argued the fact she did not have anyone else take the photos was suspicious and also added the person who registered JasmineTridevilcom was called Alisha Hessler who was no stranger to the internet.

2059,Brain surgery recovery can be a gamble but not everybody wakes up in the middle of the procedure. Surgeons do not yet know exactly how the organ works so it is always a risk. Iga Jasica a 19 year old Polish girl woke up while it was happening and gave the surgeons a surprise. The reason for the surgery was to remove a tumor which had apparently been bothering her for a while. It is suspected that the surgeons may have triggered neurons which caused her to regain consciousness and the ability to hear and speak but not the senses of sight and feeling. It was also possible that the doctors had given her the anesthetics incorrectly. Fox News claims that investigators are looking into the reason why Jasica spent part of her brain surgery awake. The surgeons may have simply activated the right neurons despite successful administration of anesthesia. The surprisingly premature brain surgery recovery is a rare situation and the surgeons said the first thing she did was ask them how is it going. Teenager wakes up while undergoing BRAIN SURGERY in Poland… and asks the surgeons how the… http tcoMerFal7GP1 via MailOnline — netdog713 January 3 2015 Iga Jasica allegedly did not appear to wake up in pain and did not sound panicked or frightened. Officials have stated that even though her brain was fully exposed there was no danger and her health was not in jeopardy. The patient reportedly felt so comfortable that as she chatted with the surgeons Jasica started talking about cats. After her successful brain surgery recovery Jasica told the Daily Mail about the experience. I can not remember much but the doctor said he talked to me about cats which I love. I missed Christmas because of this operation but it is the best present I could have had as I am now feeling great. Spending part of brain surgery awake can be a scary situation but this time everything turned out fine. It even led to an amusing tale of a 19 year old girl who got rid of a brain tumor and loves cats. Image via The Daily Mirror
735,A new video allegedly depicts the beheading of captive American journalist Steven Sotloff the Associated Press reported. If the video does indeed depict Sotloffs death it would make him the second American journalist to be executed by agents of the Islamic State sometimes known as ISIS or ISIL. Previously ISIS released footage of a British jihadi killing Jim Foley an American journalist snateched while on freelance assignment in Syria. In that video after executing Foley the militant brings out a man identified as Sotloff and says his life depends upon… Obamas next decision. The man cites aggression against IS by the US and says to deny Muslims their safety of living under the caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people. In response to the release of the Foley video the US ramped up its attacks against ISIS. President Obama asked for the help and support of the Iraqi and Syrian peoples and battling the group which he said has no place in the 21st century. Newsweek Magazine is Back In Print Sotloff has been missing in Syria since Aug 4 2013 when he was abducted after crossing into Syria from Turkey. His mother Shirley Sotloff pleaded directly with ISISs leader for her sons safe return.

My son Steven is in your hands. You the caliph can grant amnesty. I ask you please to release my child she said. I ask you to use your authority to spare his life.

The White House said it could not confirm that the man in the video was Steven Sotloff
2575,The life of Seth Rich a 27 year old Democratic National Committee staffer ended nearly a year ago when he was shot to death near his house in Washington DC. Then came the tragic and bizarre afterlife Since July Rich has been the focus of intense right wing conspiracy theories that have only escalated as the Trump administrations scandals have deepened. As the police have repeatedly stated there is no evidence that Richs death was anything other than the consequence of a botched robbery. But some people especially on the right believe Rich was murdered by the Clintons for knowing too much about something. The most recent theories claim that Rich not the Russians was responsible for leaking the emails published in WikiLeaks that revealed Democratic party leaders had talked disparagingly about Bernie Sanders. Thanks to an erroneous Fox News story last week which was finally retracted on Tuesday Rich recently became the focus of an intense media blitz from conservative outlets — many of which were eager for something to talk about besides the scandals swirling around Donald Trump. Fox Newss Sean Hannity was one of the most enthusiastic rumormongers devoting segments on three separate occasions last week to Rich. Even after Fox News retracted its story Hannity promised he would continue to investigate. I retracted nothing he said defiantly on his radio show Tuesday. Richs family has been begging right wing news outlets to stop spreading unfounded rumors about him but by now the situation seems to have gotten out of control. In death Rich has become a martyr to the right buoyed by a host of characters each with their own ulterior motives There is WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange who wants to downplay the connections between WikiLeaks and the Russians there are the Clinton haters who want to spread the idea that the Clintons are murderers there are the Trump supporters who want to minimize the idea that Russian hackers helped deliver the election to their candidate and there are the talking heads on Fox News who last week needed something other than negative Trump stories to make conversation about. We might not know who killed Seth Rich but we do know who turned his legacy into a textbook study of where fake news comes from how it spreads and the victims it creates. Seth Rich was murdered in a senseless act of violence Seth Rich worked in Democratic politics for most of his career. He grew up and went to college in Omaha Nebraska where as a student he volunteered on two Democratic Senate campaigns. After graduating he moved to Washington DC for a job at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner a progressive opinion research and consulting firm. He was later hired by the Democratic National Committee where he worked on a project to help people find where to vote. On Sunday July 10 Rich was shot to death about a block from where he lived in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of DC. Gunshot detection microphones place the time of the shooting at around 420 am. Rich had last been seen at around 130 am leaving Lous City Bar in Columbia Heights about a 40 minute walk from where he lived. It is unclear exactly what happened during those three intervening hours. The Washington Post reported that according to his parents cellphone records show that Rich called his girlfriend at 205 am and talked to her for more than two hours. He hung up just minutes before he was shot. The police found Rich on the sidewalk with multiple gunshot wounds at least two in the back. He still had his watch his cellphone and his wallet. There were signs of a struggle bruises on his hands knees and face and a torn wristwatch strap. According to the police report he was still conscious and breathing. Family members say they were told that Rich was very talkative though it is not publicly known if he was able to describe his assailant or assailants. Rich died a few hours later in the hospital. The police suspected Rich had been the victim of an attempted robbery. Bloomingdale is a gentrifying part of Washington that still suffers from violent crime. In 2016 there were 24 reported robberies with a gun that occurred within a quarter mile of the street corner where Rich was shot. The first conspiracy theories grew out of the Clinton body count rumor Almost immediately after news of Richs death conspiracy theories began circulating on social media. A few factors helped make Rich a target of speculation The murderers left behind Richs valuables. Rich worked at the DNC where in December there had been a minor scandal involving a software glitch that allowed the Bernie Sanders campaign to access private voter data collected by the Clinton campaign. Hillary Clinton had just clinched the nomination after a surprisingly bruising primary and there were still sore feelings in the air. there is a long running conspiracy theory that the Clintons have assassinated dozens of their political enemies. If those facts do not seem to add up to a coherent story well you are thinking too hard. Conspiracy theories do not operate logically. They start from an assumption — for instance the Clintons are shady — and spiral outward in search of corroboration. On Reddit for instance one user wrote a 1400 word post listing things that he found suspicious. Here were some of the stray facts the redditor claimed were evidence of a hit job by the DNC or the Clintons Richs former employer Greenberg Quinlan Rosner once did some consulting work for British Petroleum. Rich once worked on Ben Nelsons campaign for senator. The political conventions were coming up. it is unclear what any of these facts have to do with the Clintons but somehow the Reddit user concluded given his position timing in politics I believe Seth Rich was murdered by corrupt politicians for knowing too much information on election fraud. Others on Twitter and the trolling website 4chan also speculated that Rich might have crossed the Clintons in some way. Richs death seemed to fit in with the Clinton body count theory which dates to the 1990s and claims that the Clintons are so vindictive that they hire hitmen to murder people they do not like. People who believe the Clintons are murderers often point to deputy White House counsel Vince Foster who suffered from clinical depression and died of a gunshot wound to the mouth in 1993. Several investigations all ruled Fosters death a suicide but some conservatives insisted there must have been foul play. They claimed that Foster who was looking into the Clintons taxes may have uncovered evidence of corruption in connection to the Whitewater controversy a guilt by association scandal involving friends of the Clintons. The Clinton body count theory has endured over the years simply because people do not live forever. Any time someone dies who was connected to the Clintons — and since Bill Clinton was the president of the United States literally thousands of people were in his orbit — this theory is dredged up again by the tinfoil hat crowd. And then it slowly fades. At first it seemed the speculation about Seth Rich would die down quickly as well. But then 12 days later on July 22 WikiLeaks published thousands of private emails from the DNC and Rich became a politically useful distraction. Julian Assange and WikiLeaks supercharged the Seth Rich rumors A month before Rich was murdered the DNC admitted that Russian hackers had broken into its computer network gaining access to all of the DNCs emails. The thought of Russian interference in American politics was infuriating to Rich according to one person who was very close to him the Washington Post reported It was crazy. Especially for Seth. He said Oh my God. We have a foreign entity trying to get involved in our elections. That made him so angry. When WikiLeaks released its dump of DNC emails on July 22 the obvious explanation was that it had obtained those emails from the Russian hackers. This connection was later confirmed by top US intelligence agencies who concluded with high confidence that DNC servers were hacked by top Russian government hackers who had then given the emails to WikiLeaks. Moscow most likely chose WikiLeaks because of its self proclaimed reputation for authenticity the US intelligence report explained as well as for its connection to the Russian propaganda outlet Russia Today. But WikiLeaks has repeatedly denied its ties to Russia and ever since last summer it has used Seth Rich as a way to distract from claims that it abetted Russian interference in the US election. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange had his own reasons to fear a Clinton presidency — as secretary of state Clinton wanted to indict Assange for his involvement in releasing the millions of US diplomatic cables leaked by Chelsea Manning. On Dutch television in August 2016 Assange hinted that Rich not Russia may have been the source for the WikiLeaks emails. Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant risks he said. As a 27 year old works for the DNC was shot in the back murdered just a few weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington. Was he one of your sources then. the anchor asked. We do not comment on who our sources are Assange replied. Then why make the suggestion about a young guy being shot in the streets of Washington. the anchor replied. Pressed repeatedly for clarification Assange concluded that others others have suggested that. we are investigating to understand what happened in that situation with Seth Rich. I think it is a concerning situation there is not a conclusion yet. As part of its investigation WikiLeaks offered a 20000 prize in August for information about Richs murder. This is the point where Seth Rich became a prop in a game of international espionage. Trump supporters and the alt right amplified the theory that Rich was some kind of Democratic whistleblower or leaker even though the facts did not really fit this pattern. He did not have access to the DNC emails and he had never shown any prowess at hacking — being a data analyst involves a very different set of skills. Besides the DNC was not the only organization that was hacked Clinton campaign chair John Podestas personal emails for instance were stolen separately as were the emails at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Nevertheless many on the right were inspired by the WikiLeaks insinuations and started to concoct their own conspiracy theories about Richs murder. In August former House speaker and presidential candidate Newt Gingrich told a conservative talk show host that Richs death was suspicious. First of all of course it is worth talking about he said. And if Assange says he is the source Assange may know. that is not complicated. That same month Trump adviser Roger Stone claimed without evidence that Rich was murdered on his way to meet with the FBI to discuss election fraud. To Trump supporters the claim that Rich had been murdered by the Clintons had twofold appeal It reinforced the rumor that the Clintons were shady operatives and it distracted from the mounting evidence that Russia had interfered with the US election — possibly in collusion with the Trump campaign. In the presidential debate on September 26 Trump famously suggested that it could have been a lone hacker who was responsible for the stolen DNC emails. It could be Russia but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds he said. Thanks to a weird miscommunication the conspiracy theory comes back in May After the election the conspiracy theories about Seth Rich faded from public consciousness as the focus turned instead to the FBIs investigation of connections between Trump staffers and Russian agents. Suspicions still bubbled in right wing corners of Reddit and on alt right websites like Gateway Pundit and Assange continued to claim that it was not the Russians who provided the hacked emails — but most of America had moved on. But Rich returned to the news last week when the local TV station FOX 5 DC aired an interview with private investigator Rod Wheeler who claimed that sources in the FBI told him there was evidence of a connection between Rich and WikiLeaks FOX 5 DC You have sources at the FBI saying that there is information WHEELER For sure FOX 5 DC that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks. WHEELER Absolutely. Yeah. that is confirmed. Conservative media outlets jumped on the story which aired the night of Monday May 15. By Tuesday morning conservative outlets like Breitbart the Blaze and the Daily Caller all had their own pieces relaying Wheelers claims. On Tuesday Fox News added its own revelation It claimed that an unnamed federal investigator had confirmed that Rich had been in contact with WikiLeaks. I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and Wikileaks the source said according to Fox News. Fox News additionally claimed this source had evidence that Rich had given thousands of DNC emails to WikiLeaks. This was a two source story The report also said that Wheeler had independently corroborated what the anonymous federal investigator had told Fox News. But heres where it gets confusing. By Tuesday afternoon Wheeler told CNN that he had misspoken. It turns out he did not have any evidence of his own. What had happened apparently was that earlier in the week Fox News had contacted Wheeler for its own story on Rich. That was when Wheeler learned that Fox News had a source alleging there was contact between Rich and WikiLeaks. When Wheeler went on local TV on Monday night to talk about Rich he believed he was giving viewers a preview of the Fox News story set to run on Tuesday. That at least is how Wheeler explained the situation to CNN last Tuesday. Somehow through miscommunication or sloppy reporting the Fox News report used Wheeler to back up its claims about the Rich WikiLeaks connection. This was incorrect Wheeler said. He had no independent knowledge. I only got that information from the reporter at Fox News he told CNN. Yesterday after leaving it up for a week Fox News finally retracted its Seth Rich story which was down to one anonymous source. The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting an editors note explained. Upon appropriate review the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed. Conservative media has a field day it is unlikely that any of this would have been a big deal had there not been a stunning series of damaging reports about Donald Trump last week. Among other things it was revealed that Trump had shared state secrets with the Russians that he had pressured FBI Director James Comey to drop his investigation into ties between Trump affiliates and Russia and that the Russia probe had reached a current high level White House official who many suspect is Trumps son in law Jared Kushner. One way the conservative media minimized all the bad news was to focus on other stories. The latest Seth Rich allegations became a welcome distraction from the constant revelations coming out of the Washington Post and the New York Times. For instance while most outlets were covering the revelation that Trump had volunteered classified information to Russians the alt right website Breitbart devoted its front page to the Seth Rich conspiracy. Breitbart even slammed the mainstream media for ignoring the rumors about Rich Silence from Establishment Media over Seth Rich WikiLeaks Report was the title of one story. Fox News in particular devoted outsize attention to the Rich story repeatedly rehashing the conspiracy theory. On his 10 pm show Fox pundit Sean Hannity devoted segments to Rich on Tuesday Thursday and Friday last week. I am not backing off asking questions even though there is an effort that nobody talk about Seth Rich he said on Friday night. On Tuesday even after Fox News retracted the story that ignited the latest round of speculation Hannity remained convinced that the Seth Rich conspiracy theory had legs. I am not Foxcom or FoxNewscom he said on his radio show. I retracted nothing. Later that evening on his television show Hannity said that for now he would stop talking about Rich out of respect for the familys wishes. On Twitter though he was defiant claiming that liberal fascism was trying to silence his voice. Ok TO BE CLEAR I am closer to the TRUTH than ever he tweeted. Not only am I not stopping I am working harder. Please retweet he added. Rich was an unlucky victim of the conservative media The recent attention has reignited the old Seth Rich conspiracy theories bringing forth even more unsubstantiated claims. On Fox Newss Sunday morning talk show Newt Gingrich repeated his belief that Rich not Russia was responsible for the DNC hack. It turns out it was not the Russians he said. It was this young guy who I suspect was disgusted by the corruption of the Democratic National Committee. On Monday Assange issued a cryptic tweet using the hashtag SethRich which fanned the flames even further WikiLeaks has never disclosed a source. Sources sometimes talk to other parties but identities never emerge from WikiLeaks. SethRich. And on Tuesday New Zealand file sharing entrepreneur Kim Dotcom who is wanted by the US government for copyright infringement and racketeering claimed that Rich had personally contacted him in 2014 and that the two had talked about a number of topics including corruption and the influence of corporate money in politics. I know that Seth Rich was involved in the DNC leak Dotcom wrote in a statement. Richs family has repeatedly asked news outlets to stop publicizing these rumors. Those theories which some reporters have since retracted are baseless and they are unspeakably cruel Mary and Joel Rich wrote in a Washington Post op ed on Tuesday evening. Imagine that instead every call that comes in is a reporter asking what you think of a series of lies or conspiracies about the death they wrote. That nightmare is what our family goes through every day. The Riches also pushed back on some of the rumors themselves stating that the FBI had found no evidence of communication between their son and WikiLeaks and that Seth had no access to any of the DNC emails that were leaked Despite these facts our familys nightmare persists. Seths death has been turned into a political football. Every day we wake up to new headlines new lies new factual errors new people approaching us to take advantage of us and Seths legacy. It just will not stop. The amount of pain and anguish this has caused us is unbearable. With every conspiratorial flare up we are forced to relive Seths murder and a small piece of us dies as more of Seths memory is torn away from us. But to conspiracy theorists the facts have never mattered. Fake news always has ulterior motives and everybody who amplified the Seth Rich conspiracy theories had their own stake in keeping the lies alive
925,The tubby dictator has become hooked on Emmental and appeared on TV with a swollen face and a limp at a recent ­ceremony in the capital Pyongyang Portly despot Kim Jong un is absolutely crackers – about Swiss cheese. The tubby North Korean dictator has become hooked on Emmental and has gorged on so much that he has ballooned in size and is now walking with a limp. The 31 year old fell in love with the holey treat when he was a student in Switzerland. He now imports it for his own consumption while millions of his citizens starve. A gloomy Jong un appeared on TV with a swollen face and a limp at a recent ­ceremony in the capital Pyongyang to mark the 20th anniversary of the death of the nations founder Kim Il sung. It prompted dissidents who have fled the closed nation to reveal he is in poor health due to his increasing weight. Reuters Ill. Dissidents who have left the country reveal he is in poor health They believe Jong un stuffs himself to look like his grandfather. Defector Cho Myung Chul of the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy said North Koreans think being fat is good unlike South Koreans who want to be skinny. There is a high chance Jong un intentionally gained weight to look like Il sung. Jong un even sent envoys to France to try and enrol North Korean cooks on cheese making courses. The director of National Dairy Industry College Veronique Drouet said the Korean request was politely but firmly declined. An American was arrested by South Korean marines as he tried to swim up a river into North Korea. The man in his 20s or 30s was found clinging to the bank suffering from exhaustion. VIEW GALLERY
429,Hewlett Packard is now forging ahead with plans to split off its PC and printer businesses into a separate company with the rest of the companys enterprise portfolio staying together in a separate entity to be called Hewlett Packard Enterprise the company said early Monday morning. The Hewlett Packard enterprise unit comprising servers storage networking converged systems services and software and the OpenStack Helion cloud will be led by Meg Whitman as president and CEO. Pat Russo will be chairman of that board. The PC and printer entity to be known as HP Inc will be led by Dion Weisler as president and CEO with Whitman as chairman. The Wall Street Journal was first to report this news Sunday afternoon. Get all the news you need about Tech with the Gigaom newsletter SIGN UP Our work during the past three years has significantly strengthened our core businesses to the point where we can more aggressively go after the opportunities created by a rapidly changing market Whitman said in a statement. The decision to separate into two market leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan. It will provide each new company with the independence focus financial resources and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics while generating long term value for shareholders. HP truly an iconic IT company has been slammed in the past decade by the shift to mobile devices and cloud and a series of management fiascos including the short lived tenure of former CEO Leo Apotheker. Under his watch the company considered selling off its still huge PC business a plan that was scotched by Whitman when she took the reins in 2011. The rationale behind holding onto the PC business was that it gave HP huge volume buying power advantages in procuring chips and other components for its server business as well. Toni Sacconaghi senior analyst with Bernstein Research wrote in a note that while a split up of HP is hardly a new topic his take is that the spin off seems to be fueled by weakness at HP rather than strength. He also noted that HP in the past few months came close to buying Rackspace for nearly 6 billion nearly bought EMC and apparently has shopped various parts of its portfolio PCs its Unix business IT Services. In another research report released before the news was official Wells Fargo analyst Maynard Um wrote We believe a separation may suggest HP could become more active in both divestitures and acquisitions which we believed would be increasingly necessary in FY2015. While this is somewhat of an about face from its prior stance that it was better together we believe this if true is likely to be driven by competitive market dynamics as well as a stabilization in its PC business. The separation which HP said will be tax free to shareholders in terms of federal income taxes is slated to be done by the end of HPs 2015 fiscal year ending October 31 2015.

1511,According to CNNs Brian Stelter hackers of Sony Pictures has sent the company a messaging praising its decision to pull The Interview as a very wise decision. The collective had threatened attacks on theaters if the movie was not pulled. According to reports on Friday the FBI has determined that North Korea was behind the hack
894,In a recent thread on Reddit one Apple customer describes an experience in which he effected change in Apples daily operations specifically as it pertains to on hold music after contacting CEO Tim Cook via email. Since the days of Steve Jobs Apples chief executives have been famously open to customer suggestions complaints and praise often engaging with the public via work email accounts. As noted by TUAW that tradition appears to carry on with current CEO Tim Cook. According to one account shared on Reddit — in response to an earlier post on efforts taken by Apples Maps team to correct erroneous address data — a customer was reportedly able to induce change in the quality of on hold music used by Apples call center. I once sent Tim an email about the quality of music while on hold with Apple. It was super low quality therefore an upbeat rock song sounded like pure distortion and really aggravated me because I was on hold for 20 minutes for something so simple. Much to my surprise a lady from Cupertino called me up the next day saying she had received a concerning email from Tim about ugly distortion hold music while on the phone that Tim had tested this himself and agreed that something had to be done. She assured me that the hold music would be tested to make sure it sounded pleasant on all types of phones and connections. The next time I called Apple the hold music was indeed very pleasant. Cook is known to be just as open to criticism. During an interview with NBCs Brian Williams in 2012 Cook admitted he routinely receives hundreds of emails from customers every day. I get hundreds and some days thousands of emails from customers. This is a privilege because they talk to you as if you are sitting at their kitchen table Cook said at the time. Because they care so deeply about Apple they want to make a suggestion or want to ask for help on something or want to tell you how much they love the product
810,A Russian fisherman says the only thing that prevented a brown bear from killing him was Justin Bieber—specifically a ringtone of Biebers first big hit Baby. Igor Vorozhbitsyn 42 had parked his car and started walking toward the fishing spot he had marked out for that day when the bear jumped him from behind. There was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me he said according to the Daily Mail. The bear mauled Vorozhbitsyns face and chest inflicting serious cuts and bruises. He believes it probably would have killed him if his phone had not gone off in the nick of time blaring Baby loudly enough to drive the bear away. After narrowly escaping death he also escaped a lifetime of being known as a Belieber. I know that sort of ringtone is not to everyones taste but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke the fisherman said. The Mail quotes a bear expert as saying there was not anything about Biebers music in particular that bears find offensive but sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear. what is up bitch. Bieber said albeit earlier and in a completely non bear related context
750,Iraq has urged the United Nations to investigate Islamic State terrorists bloody trade in human organs after the Iraqi ambassador said doctors are being executed for not harvesting body parts. Mohamed Alhakim claimed that dozens of bodies with surgical incisions and missing body parts have been found in shallow mass graves near ISIS stronghold Mosul over the past few weeks. ISIS horrifying trade in human organs which was revealed by MailOnline last December is just the latest way for the terrorist organisation to finance its activities with other major sources of the groups 2 million a day income being the sale of oil ransom payments and smuggled antiques. Lucrative ISIS has set up a specialist organ smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market Speaking of ISIS organ harvesting operations Mr Alhakim said We have bodies. Come and examine them. It is clear they are missing certain parts. He also said a dozen doctors have been executed in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting. Mr Alhakim briefed the UN Security Council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused ISIS of crimes of genocide in targeting certain ethnic groups. The outgoing UN envoy to Iraq Nikolay Mladenov also told the council that last month alone 790 people were killed by terrorism and armed conflict in the country. He also noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that IS is using organ harvesting as a financing method but he said only that it is very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day. He used an acronym for the group. Making them rich Mohamed Alhakim claimed that dozens of bodies with surgical incisions and missing body parts have been found in shallow mass graves near ISIS stronghold Mosul over the past few weeks Mr Mladenov said Iraqs most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that ISIS has seized over the past year. The Sunni militants currently controls around a third of both Iraq and neighbouring Syria and imposed its strict interpretation of Sharia law in its self declared caliphate subjecting a population of around four million people to a brutal campaign of rape and massacre. Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control Mr Mladenov said using an alternative acronym for the group known as ISIS in the West and Daesh in Arab nations. The shocking news of ISIS trade in human organs was first revealed in a report by al Monitor news website in December citing an Iraqi ear nose and throat doctor named Siruwan al Mosuli. He told the site that ISIS commanders hired foreign doctors to run an extensive organ trafficking system from a hospital in Mosul that is already beginning to generate huge profits. Militants Each of the letters is signed with a purple stamp indicating the province from which it was sent. They are understood to have been handed to ISIS network of messengers and fighters The al Monitor report also claims the terror organisation has even set up a specialist organ smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market. Al Mosuli said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul Arab and foreign surgeons were hired but prohibited from mixing with local doctors the reports author wrote. Information then leaked about organ selling. The report went on Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped. Most of the organs are then smuggled out of Syria and Iraq into neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia or Turkey where criminal gangs sell them on to shady buyers across the globe the Assyrian International News Agency reported. While organ harvesting may be the most shocking of IS revenue streams the report highlights a string of others that contribute to the groups 2million annual income. Security ISIS horrifying trade in human organs which was revealed by MailOnline last December is just the latest way for the terrorist organisation to finance its activities with other major sources of the groups 2 million a day income being the sale of oil ransom payments and smuggled antiques Intelligence chiefs are investigating claims the Islamic State jihadi who led the executions of 21 Egyptians was an American recruit. The militant who spoke English with a US accent appeared in a horrific video on Sunday showing the beheadings of a group of Coptic Christians on a beach in Libya. Brandishing a knife he declares All crusaders the sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Ladens body in we swear to Allah we will mix it with your blood. The men are then forced to lie face down before they are beheaded simultaneously. US officials are understood to be analysing the militants facial features and speech patterns as has been done in the hunt for the British executioner known as Jihadi John who has appeared in a number of beheading videos in Syria. Professor Erik Thomas a linguistics expert at North Carolina State University believes he sounds like an American with some Arabic influence based on some of word pronunciations. One tactic is smuggling families and individuals into other countries. The report highlights one instance when a family paid ISIS over 8000 per individual to sneak them into Turkey. Drug smuggling is another. Al Monitors report claims that IS traffics Afghan heroin into Europe from the city of Nineveh which the Russian Federal Drug Control Service says is generating significant revenues. Its drug business has become so successful in recent months that the RFDCS claims that IS now supplies half of Europes entire heroin market. Yesterday it was revealed that militants fighting for ISIS in Syria are making millions of pounds selling ancient statues and mosaics to wealthy Westerners using a complex system of smugglers and middle men. Looted from ancient buildings in ISIS strongholds such as the groups de facto capital city Raqqa the antiquities are up to 10000 years old and can exchange hands for more than 1 million each. The most expensive items are covertly smuggled overseas usually on the orders of wealthy Europeans but there is also a lucrative trade in less historically important objects which often find their way into tourist shops and markets in neighbouring Lebanon and Turkey. The trade in antiquities is one of ISIS primary sources of funding along with oil and ransom payments and is estimated to fills the terrorists coffers with tens of millions of pounds every year. The finer points of ISIS trade in antiquities was uncovered in an investigation by the BBC. It revealed that ISIS militants charge smugglers 20 per cent on the sale of ancient items found or looted in territory under its control. If the smugglers decide not to buy the items they are promptly smashed to pieces as examples of idolatry regardless of their historic significance
2382,The worlds werewolf population likely will have one less member to add to its rolls thanks to the benevolence of Argentine President Christina Fernandez de Kirchner. Under a law the country has followed since the 1920s to counteract a generations old legend Fernandez adopted Yail Tawil her godson who was destined as the seventh son of his family to become a werewolf according to various published reports and the presidents own tweets. The happy family Argentina passed the law because the belief in the curse became so widespread that families were abandoning putting up for adoption and in some cases killing their seventh sons according to The Jerusalem Post. Tawils parents wrote Fernandez a letter asking her to take on Tawil as her godson to which she agreed in a ceremony she described to her Twitter followers as magical. Many media reports described Tawil as a boy but The Guardian said he is 21. Editors note This story was updated to include The Guardian report that Tawil is 21 years old
325,Yes that is right. Last week Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner adopted a boy as her godson to prevent him from turning into a werewolf according to multiple news reports. She tweeted images of a small ceremony conducted with the family of Yair Tawil the seventh child of an Argentine Jewish family during which the Tawils met with the president and lit candles on a menorah. Tenía razón. Me trajeron de regalo un candelabro de Israel. Me pidieron que encendiera las velas… pictwittercomDVWewmZera — Cristina Kirchner December 23 2014 A tradition holds that the seventh son of a family is doomed to turn into a werewolf — known as el lobison in Argentina — after his 13th birthday and will stalk the night in its beastly form feeding on the dead and murdering all before it. The legend stems from indigenous folklore and melded with superstitions of European settlers in the 19th century. The fear of this werewolf child was so pronounced that many seventh sons were killed after they were born which started the practice in 1907 of Argentine leaders taking these children symbolically under their wing. In the past half century the ceremonies have been opened up to girls and now for the first time Jews. The Tawil family appealed to the Argentine government as early as the 1990s to have the practice extended to non Catholic families. The boys new status as the presidents godson wins him a gold medal as well as a full educational scholarship according to the Independent. Tales of shape shifting demons and feral monsters slaughtering livestock can be found in many parts of Latin America. This Argentine iteration can be traced to a local Guarani story of the seven cursed spawn of Tau an evil mythological spirit and Kerana a beautiful woman he seduced and kidnapped. The seventh son was Luison who appears sometimes in the shape of a small dog and eats corpses. Some historians dispute the connection between beliefs about this folk horror and the presidential act of adopting a seventh son as a godson and suggest the latter is a distinct custom brought over by Eastern European migrants. Americans should not be so quick to scoff at the tradition and its embrace by Argentinas head of state. After all the US president participates in the ritual pardoning of a fluffy and presumably bewildered animal every year

2542,Remember the 70s when doctors equated eggs with cholesterol and heart disease. A recent Canadian study involving over 1200 adults published in the peer reviewed journal Atherosclerosis says that eating eggs yolks is about as bad as smoking cigarettes when it comes to advancing coronary heart disease. we are already seeing cracks in the theory. In the study researchers recorded the number of eggs eaten and packs of cigarettes smoked as recalled by each adult. Everyone in the study had been referred to a vascular prevention clinic at a Canadian hospital meaning their heart health was already in question. The researchers found that as expected plaque build up in their subjects carotid artery thickened with age and even correlated with smoking and egg eating habits. Publications like The Daily Mail and Fox News have reported blindly on the matter but thankfully there are others out there suspiciously raising eyebrows. The UKs National Health Service points out some of the studys limitations including The accuracy of the participants recollections of egg yolk consumption. A lack of details regarding how the eggs were cooked. Disregard for other factors of heart disease advancement including but not limited to exercise alcohol consumption antidepressant use and other important dietary factors. Neither the study in question nor the NHS takes into consideration however The harmful effects of the chemicals and hormones found in non organic eggs. The effects on the human body from eating eggs from chicken given GMO feed. The living condition of the chickens. Non organic eggs can contain the same antibiotics chemicals and hormones administered to conventional chickens. Add GMO feed polluted water and unsanitary living conditions to these chickens and you may have eggs that are little more than hard shelled pellets of poison. Organic eggs from healthy chickens on GMO free feed have actually shown in many studies to prevent heart disease. They contain healthful amounts of protein vitamin B omega 3 fatty acids and many nutrients like lutein and zeaxanthin which reduce risk for age related macular degeneration a major cause of blindness. The key. Moderation as with most things and buying organic eggs from local farmers who can raise their chickens in truly cage free conditions. Happy healthy chickens produce more healthful eggs
1189,Microsoft the parent company of the Xbox and Windows brands is apparently in serious discussions to purchase Mojang according to The Wall Street Journal. Mojang of course is best known for its massively popular Minecraft series. WSJ cites a person with knowledge of the matter in their story and says the valuation of Mojang could be more than 2 billion. Microsoft and Mojang both declined to comment to WSJ we have reached out to Mojang for additional comment. Mojang founded by developer Markus Persson in 2009 has two still unreleased games in development Cobalt and Scrolls as well as Minecraft which it is still endlessly iterating on with updates and ports. Microsofts investment to purchase Mojang if true would give the company complete control over not only the studios upcoming games but it is all important insanely lucrative Minecraft series. As of June the game has sold over 54 million copies and has actually sold best on consoles which bodes well for Microsofts Xbox 360 and Xbox One. Minecraft launched in late 2011 on PC and we loved it. It later migrated to iOS and Android before coming to Xbox 360 in 2012 where it sold like gangbusters. A PlayStation 3 iteration launched late in 2013 which we also loved and the game just came to both Xbox One and PlayStation 4. You can read our review here. The only other known upcoming version of the game for Vita is due out in the coming couple of months. What do you make of this news. Do you think Microsoft will purchase Mojang. If so do you think it will benefit the company
1324,The masked terrorist — suspected of carrying out beheadings Western prisoners including American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff — was injured in a bombing raid on Nov 8 the Mail Online reported Saturday. The bloodthirsty Islamic State executioner dubbed Jihadi John is said to have been wounded by US led air strike on the Iraqi Syrian border according to a report. The masked terrorist — suspected of carrying out beheadings Western prisoners including American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff — was injured in a bombing raid on Nov 8 the Mail Online reported Saturday. The Mail cited an unnamed nurse saying Jihadi John was among several Islamic State leaders wounded in the air strike in the western Iraqi town of Al Qaim. The cold blooded killer was among a group of high level ISIS leaders meeting in an underground bunker targeted by US and Iraqi bomber jets Mail reported. Jihadi John who spoke with a British accent in the ISIS released snuff videos was said to have narrowly escaped with his life. He and others were treated at the Al Qaim General Hospital and then driven to Syria a nurse told the Mail. The nurse among the emergency team that treated the wounded terrorists also said that top ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi was also wounded in the strike. Earlier reports of Al Baghadadi being killed or severely wounded in the air strike have been debunked. An audio tape emerged Thursday of Al Baghdadi mentioning developments that have occurred since the Al Qaim air strike and imploring his followers to keep fighting even if only one soldier remains. In a statement Saturday the British Foreign Office could neither confirm nor deny the reports. We are aware of the reports the Foreign Office statement reads. We can not confirm these reports. whutchinson nydailynewscom
785,She made headlines around the world when she revealed she paid thousands of dollars to get a third breast surgically attached to her chest. But now Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil is facing claims that the surgery is a fake and she made it all up. The claims come as Tampa Bays 10 News revealed Tridevil whose real name is Alisha Jasmine Hessler had filed an incident report after losing a three breast prosthesis earlier this month. Tridevil filed the report after her bag was stolen from Tampa International Airport on Sept 16. The luggage which was stolen allegedly contained a fake breast and 10 News obtained the report which listed the missing contents including a 3 breasts prosthesis. However Tridevil claims she underwent her surgery a few months ago and it cost 20000. Internet rumor site Snopes also discovered that her JasmineTridevilcom site is registered to Alisha Hessler someone to whom Tridevil bears a striking resemblance. However when 10 News reporter Charles Bill tracked her down Tridevil insisted her surgery and third breast were the real deal. I figured people would be skeptical but it is true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show she said. Photo FaceookTridevil insisted the surgery went ahead and she tried 50 to 60 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery. Surgeons have also dismissed the possibility of it being real. New York plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman told The Daily Dot I believe 100 percent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for. I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible. Michigan surgeon Dr Anthony Youn agreed that while the surgery was possible it was highly unlikely that anyone would perform it. In a YouTube clip Tridevil said the extra breast felt like her other two but that the only difference is the nipple which she had to get tattooed on. The 21 year old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around. She also said her surgery was documented by a film crew and will prove her story is true. Tridevil has received plenty of venom on social media and just hours ago posted Pain is temporary glory is forever on her Facebook page. Just an hour earlier she wrote do not be afraid to be different … that is what makes you beautiful and also posted a photo of her pre surgery which won her a host of compliments and questions as to why she would want to change. it is not the first time Hessler has made headlines. Last year she chose to publicly humiliate a man who beat her instead of sending him to prison. She said she was introduced to the man when friends of hers invited him out clubbing last December and he beat her after he made unwanted sexual advances. She received hospital treatment and a police report was filed. But instead of pressing charges she offered her attacker an ultimatum telling him I can either press charges and have you arrested for a year or I can have you sit outside at a busy intersection for 8 hours holding up a sign that says I beat women.

980,Share by email IBM is reportedly planning its largest corporate layoff ever cutting 111800 of its staff. A report by a respected Silicon Valley journalist for Forbes said around 26 of the companys 430000 strong workforce would be cut this week. The previous largest corporate redundancy was also carried out by IBM when it cut 60000 staff in 1993. The companys reorganisation is codenamed Project Chrome and most of the staff being laid off are in the US. It will pave the way for IBM to focus on cloud computing it is claimed rather than its traditional hardware business. Reporter Robert X Cringely wrote To fix its business problems and speed up its transformation next week about 26 of IBMs employees will be getting phone calls from their managers. A few hours later a package will appear on their doorsteps with all the paperwork. However some technology commentators have said they are sceptical about the size of the reported cuts. In a statement to Sky News an IBM spokeswoman said the rumour was ridiculous and baseless. She said If anyone had checked information readily available from our public earnings statements or had simply asked us they would know that IBM has already announced the company has just taken a 600 million charge for workforce rebalancing. This equates to several thousand people a mere fraction of what is been reported. Last year IBM hired 45000 people and the company currently has about 15000 job openings around the world for new skills in growth areas such as cloud analytics security and social and mobile technologies. This is evidence that IBM continues to remix its skills to match where we see the best opportunities in the marketplace. IBM was founded in 1911 and adopted the name International Business Machines in 1924. It currently creates hardware and software and provides infrastructure hosting and consulting services. It has revenue of around 90bn and is one of the most profitable companies in the US
1945,CHICAGO A frustrated office worker recently called out his colleague for stealing his lunch prompting a response from the sandwich thief himself. The frustrated worker posted a sign on the fridge saying To the person who keeps stealing my sandwiches this is ridiculous. We are full grown adults not children. Please take responsibility for your actions and stop stealing other peoples property. The sandwich thief then came back with a response asking for ransom money for the stolen turkey and Swiss on rye. Dear turkey and Swiss on rye I have your precious sandwich. it is safe. For now. Put 10 dollars on the plate in the fridge or you will never see it undigested again. HR then got involved in the situation and told the alleged thief to give back the sandwich and it will not be investigated. But it was too late the sandwich thief already had eaten the coveted lunch. But he did not get away with it. HR was able to track down the crook. Click here for more on this story from the Daily Mail
2559,Jared Kushner and Russias ambassador to Washington discussed the possibility of setting up a secret and secure communications channel between Trumps transition team and the Kremlin using Russian diplomatic facilities in an apparent move to shield their pre inauguration discussions from monitoring according to US officials briefed on intelligence reports. Ambassador Sergey Kislyak reported to his superiors in Moscow that Kushner son in law and confidant to then President elect Trump made the proposal during a meeting on Dec 1 or 2 at Trump Tower according to intercepts of Russian communications that were reviewed by US officials. Kislyak said Kushner suggested using Russian diplomatic facilities in the United States for the communications. The meeting also was attended by Michael Flynn Trumps first national security adviser. The White House disclosed the meeting only in March playing down its significance. But people familiar with the matter say the FBI now considers the encounter as well as another meeting Kushner had with a Russian banker to be of investigative interest. Kislyak reportedly was taken aback by the suggestion of allowing an American to use Russian communications gear at its embassy or consulate — a proposal that would have carried security risks for Moscow as well as the Trump team. Neither the meeting nor the communications of Americans involved were under US surveillance officials said. The White House declined to comment. Robert Kelner a lawyer for Flynn declined to comment. The Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment. Russia at times feeds false information into communication streams it suspects are monitored as a way of sowing misinformation and confusion among US analysts. But officials said that it is unclear what Kislyak would have had to gain by falsely characterizing his contacts with Kushner to Moscow particularly at a time when the Kremlin still saw the prospect of dramatically improved relations with Trump. Kushners apparent interest in establishing a secret channel with Moscow rather than relying on US government systems has added to the intrigue surrounding the Trump administrations relationship with Russia. The FBI closely monitors the communications of Russian officials in the United States and it maintains a nearly constant surveillance of its diplomatic facilities. The National Security Agency monitors the communications of Russian officials overseas. Current and former US intelligence officials said that although Russian diplomats have secure means of communicating with Moscow Kushners apparent request for access to such channels was extraordinary. How would he trust that the Russians would not leak it on their side. said one former senior intelligence official. The FBI would know that a Trump transition official was going in and out of the embassy which would cause a great deal of concern he added. The entire idea he said seems extremely naive or absolutely crazy. The discussion of a secret channel adds to a broader pattern of efforts by Trumps closest advisers to obscure their contacts with Russian counterparts. Trumps first national security adviser Flynn was forced to resign after a series of false statements about his conversations with Kislyak. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from matters related to the Russia investigation after it was revealed that he had failed to disclose his own meetings with Kislyak when asked during congressional testimony about any contact with Russians. Kushners interactions with Russians — including Kislyak and an executive for a Russian bank under US sanctions — were not acknowledged by the White House until they were exposed in media reports. It is common for senior advisers of a newly elected president to be in contact with foreign leaders and officials. But new administrations are generally cautious in their handling of interactions with Moscow which US intelligence agencies have accused of waging an unprecedented campaign to interfere in last years presidential race and help elect Trump. Obama administration officials say members of the Trump transition team never approached them about arranging a secure communications channel with their Russian contacts possibly because of concerns about leaks. The State Department the White House National Security Council and US intelligence agencies all have the ability to set up secure communications channels with foreign leaders though doing so for a transition team would be unusual. Trumps advisers were similarly secretive about meetings with leaders from the United Arab Emirates. The Obama White House only learned that the crown prince of Abu Dhabi was flying to New York in December to see Kushner Flynn and Stephen K Bannon another top Trump adviser because US border agents in the UAE spotted the Emirate leaders name on a flight manifest. Russia would also have had reasons of its own to reject such an overture from Kushner. Doing so would require Moscow to expose its most sophisticated communications capabilities — which are likely housed in highly secure locations at diplomatic compounds — to an American. The Post was first alerted in mid December to the meeting by an anonymous letter which said among other things that Kushner had talked to Kislyak about setting up the communications channel. This week officials who reviewed the letter and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence said the portion about the secret channel was consistent with their understanding of events. For instance according to those officials and the letter Kushner conveyed to the Russians that he was aware that it would be politically sensitive to meet publicly but it was necessary for the Trump team to be able to continue their communication with Russian government officials. In addition to their discussion about setting up the communications channel Kushner Flynn and Kislyak also talked about arranging a meeting between a representative of Trump and a Russian contact in a third country whose name was not identified according to the anonymous letter. The Post reported in April that Erik Prince the founder of the private security firm Blackwater now called Academi and an informal adviser to the Trump transition team met on Jan 11 — nine days before Trumps inauguration — in the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean with a representative of Russian President Vladimir Putin

680,Isis fighter denies claim and says organ harvesting would bring in peanuts Iraqs ambassador to the United Nations is calling on the UN Security Council to investigate allegations that Isis is harvesting organs telling ministers We have bodies. Come and examine them. It is clear they are missing certain parts. Mohamed Alhakim claimed militants are harvesting the organs as a way of financing the extremist groups activities. He also told journalists doctors in Mosul were executed for refusing to harvest organs the Associated Press reports. Mr Alhakim said bodies with surgical incisions and missing organs had been discovered in shallow mass graves. He was earlier speaking to the UN council about the state of affairs in Iraq where he also accused Isis of crimes of genocide in targeting certain ethnic groups. However Elijah J Magnier Al Rais chief international correspondent said Mr Alhakims claims should be treated cautiously. He told The Independent Isis does not have the market in this current global war against it to be engaged in this business organ harvesting. This requires contacts that Isis is losing. An Isis fighter was also quick to deny claims made by Mr Alhakim saying the group would not have time to collect the organs of those they killed. He was quoted by Mr Magnier as saying If these claims were true this would be a general policy for Isis that it would not be possible to hide. People are shot in the head beheaded bodies thrown in the desert others left in the battle field and more were dropped in deep wells. Fighters do not have the time to stop in the battle field and collect bodies of their own fighters. So how could we collect bodies of those we kill and transport them to sell their organs. Another fighter said it would be easier to harvest organs from prisoners but the group chooses not to saying Organs are preserved naturally in prisoners and could be harvested when needed. It is easier to harvest organs from prisoners than from the dead which is not the case. The militant stressed that organ selling would not raise substantial funds to maintain the group saying The West is trying to find out where our funding comes from. This organ selling would bring in peanuts in comparison what an Isis army needs each day. Some of Isiss known sources of finance include oil and taxes on every house shop vehicle and any goods crossing into Isis controlled areas. Isis also reportedly imposes fines for civilians caught breaking rules in Raqqa the groups Syrian stronghold. Activists recently spoke of the plight faced by citizens living under the groups self declared caliphate who face being publicly flogged paying huge fines and even reportedly execution for crimes such as smoking
2546,Poor old saturated fat. For over forty years now it is been spoken of only in hushed tones dissed as nothing but artery clogging obesity causing poison. This common sense fact has become so widely accepted that a lot of people who want to improve their diet start by purchasing skim milk ditching their egg yolks and beginning a life free of steak pork and butter. it is time to bring bacon back to breakfast. After all saturated fat is good for you. we have Made a Huge Mistake But we all make mistakes. This one started in 1970 with the first publication of The Seven Countries Study. The research looked at the incidences of saturated fat intake and heart disease among 12763 men from seven different countries and showed a correlation between the two. Unfortunately the study was deeply flawed It did not take into account important factors like smoking rates sugar consumption and exercise levels and it left out an awful lot of data from other countries that contradicted the conclusions. The studys authors actually had access to twenty two countries data and did not discuss any of the populations that followed diets with plenty of saturated fat and barely experienced any heart disease. Such communities include the Kenyan Masai the Tokelau in Polynesia and the Arctic Inuit. Governments followed by making the supposed saturated fat heart disease connection a matter of public health policy an ideology which probably culminated with the abominable food pyramid of the 1990s — which recommended up to 11 servings of rice and pasta per day and about as little fat as possible. The result. In the past 30 years in the United States the amount of calories from consumed fat has fallen from 40 percent to 30 percent while obesity has doubled and heart disease has remained the countrys number one killer. But the spread of obesity has no single cause there are a lot of complicated factors that have led to Americas health crisis. To figure out whether saturated fat should be added back into our diets let us take a closer look at its effect on the body. Why Saturated Fat does not Cause Heart Disease In a 2010 evaluation of 21 studies and 350000 subjects saturated fat was not associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease — and numerous other studies have reached similar conclusions. Of course these studies are not without controversy. For instance Greatist expert and physician Dr James Hardeman believes those 21 studies are not comprehensive enough on average their subjects were studied for around 14 years which may not be long enough to see the effects of a diet high in saturated fat. However they raise important questions about saturated fats effects on the arteries of the heart and brain. PIN IT But what about cholesterol. We actually have two kinds of cholesterol in our blood the HDL and LDL. Total cholesterol levels are less important than the ratio of HDL to LDL but a simpler approach is that we should try to increase HDL and decrease LDL. Saturated fat is generally believed to increase the bad cholesterol. But that is only part of the story because there are also two kinds of LDL cholesterol big floaty particles and small dense ones. When someone reduces their consumption of saturated fat and their LDL cholesterol drops they are only lowering their type A particles. But it is the type B particles that are more closely linked in heart disease and they are generally controlled by carbohydrate consumption. So the best way to cut out harmful types of cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease could be to follow a diet that is low in carbs rather than fat. Why Saturated Fat Can Be Good For You Saturated fat has been shown to have loads of positive effects on the body including Liver Health Saturated fat encourages the liver cells to dump their fat cells which helps the liver to function more effectively. Immunity Saturated fatty acids especially the kinds found in butter and coconut help white blood cells to recognize and destroy invading viruses and bacteria. Go get em boys. Hormones Eating saturated fat tends to increase free testosterone levels which helps to repair tissue preserve muscle and improve sexual function. Now fat is high in calories so it can promote weight gain in that respect. Per gram it has more than twice the calories of protein or carbohydrates. But provided an eye is kept on portion size saturated fat in and of itself does not have any negative impact on the body. In fact increasing fat intake might help with weight loss One study found that when three groups of obese people were fed diets of 90 percent fat 90 percent protein and 90 percent carbohydrates respectively the high fat group lost the most weight. Plus it tastes freaking delicious. DROP THAT HOT DOG. This does not mean every source of saturated fat is healthy. Case in point A study from the Harvard School of Public Health found that after analyzing the diets of 12 million people there was no association between eating red meat and heart disease — but there was for those who ate a lot of processed meat. That is to say if we are going to get sick from eating meat or saturated fat it will be by getting it from a crappy source. Basically we should spend a little more on food. The body loves saturated fat but from sources like grass fed meat and butter whole eggs and coconut fat — not hot dogs and pepperoni pizza. By a mile the biggest enemy in our food is likely refined sugar. Even the American Heart Association which is still anti saturated fat agrees that sugar is a far bigger contributor to heart disease. But the tide is very slowly starting to turn. Prominent journals and scientists are beginning to speak out on saturated fats benefits and after government scientists reviewed 16000 studies on diet and obesity Sweden recently became the first Western country to advocate a high fat diet to its citizens. that is because heart disease and obesity are caused by inactivity trans fats refined carbs and overeating to name a few — but not saturated fat. Toss the margarine and tuck into some buttered vegetables or a seared steak. We think you deserve it

CNN reported a source revealed to them a staff member at Manhattans Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators that an unidentified doctor snapped a selfie with Rivers while she was under anesthesia and performed an unauthorized biopsy on her throat. Investigators think swelling of her vocal chords during the procedure caused Rivers to go into cardiac arrest and authorities rushed her from the clinic to Mount Sinai Hospital according to CNN. Rivers died at the hospital a week later and her death is still under investigation
1874,KABUL Afghanistan — An Afghan mother has become a hero among some of her countrymen after allegedly fighting the Taliban militants who had just killed her policeman son. Reza Gul a resident of Balabolok district of western Farah province said she rushed to the small police outpost near her home after it came under attack early on November 17. She told NBC News she screamed in anger and grief when she saw her son Safiullah — who had been guarding the outpost along with a group of lightly armed policemen — shot dead. Then she said she took action. The Taliban attacked our village and my sons outpost at dawn explained Gul who like many in Afghanistan does not know her exact age but who estimates she is between 50 and 60. After seeing my young sons body I picked up his gun and decided to fight off the killers of my son until I die. Gul spoke to NBC News by telephone from Farah the capital of Farah Province. NBC News could not independently confirm Guls account although local police and media repeated similar versions of the incident. I fought them until dark along with other boys from the police and we killed at least 25 of them she added saying that her husband daughter in law daughter and her teenage son also joined in and supplied her with ammunition. Guls daughter Fatima told Afghan television channel Tolo News that she had prepared bullets for her father and mother to fight. We started a kind of family war against the Taliban she said. Guls daughter in law Seema told Tolo News that the fighting intensified when she reached the battlefield armed with a variety of light and heavy weapons but that we were committed to fight until the last bullet. Provincial police chief General Abdul Razaq Yaqoobi confirmed that the Taliban had launched a heavy assault on Balabolok district on November 17 with an estimated 400 fighters. The police post in Abdul Satar village which was manned by 10 local police and commanded by a local police officer named Safiullah came under heavy shelling and the commander was killed in the gun battle he said. He added that Safiullahs mother had joined the policemen after learning of her sons death and taken up his rifle. The mothers presence boosted the morale of policemen resisting the attack Yaqoobi said and after seven hours of heavy fighting the Taliban fled. At least 25 Taliban militants were killed and 31 injured in that village alone Yaqoobi added. News of Reza Gul fighting the Taliban lit up Afghan social media with some comparing her to the legendary female folk hero Malalai of Maiwand who allegedly rallied fighters against the British during the second Anglo Afghan war of 1879
2095,Remember the crunch of the cornmeal crust. And the stringy cheese with a slightly sweeter than normal marinara underneath. Maybe you shoved french fries in it like birthday candles. Or ate it crust first as was the style at the time. In any case if you are a child of the nineties you remember it well McDonalds pizza. And like pogs and Beanie Babies it too disappeared with the innocence of your childhood. Except in two magical locations in Ohio and West Virginia where one hero owner has kept the McDonalds pizza ovens burning all these years later. So bust out a gel pen to jot down these directions because I am about to tell you where you can still buy McDonalds pizza. Neslted on the banks of the Ohio River along the border with West Virginia sits the village of Pomeroy population 1852 in the 2010 census. And its McDonalds located along Main Street on the riverbank still pumps out pizza — in five minutes or less of course. it is just a seven and a half hour drive from Toronto in zero traffic according to Google Maps. And thanks to owner Greg Mills there is another McDs where you can still get a slice just over ninety kilometres away across the state border. Spencer West Virginia also boasts a McDonalds that is still lighting the pizza fires — or electrical coils as the case may be. According to employee Judy Norman it is the same pizza as they sold when she started there 11 years ago and it is presumably the same that children everywhere enjoyed throughout the 1990s. She said the location sold 13 pizzas yesterday but there are days when everyone wants pizza and there are days where just every so often you get a pizza order. Mills who it is pretty safe to call an American hero for preserving this very unique pizza could not not be immediately reached for comment but this post will be updated should he return our calls. Whatever actually happened to McDonalds pizza you ask. Well for starters it turned out adult palates did not quite take to it the same way kids did. When McDonalds first launched its pizza in the Canadian market in the early 90s it was tapping into a growing appetite for pizza as burger sales dwindled. It even launched hockey themed TV ads. The market for the savoury pie topped 2 billion in the early 90s according to a 2004 National Post article on the death of McDonalds pizza. And the company poured 25 million into the ovens alone across Canada to moderate success throughout the decade. Then the drive through took over — remember waiting for your pizza to be delivered with a plastic number on top of your car. — and pizza slowed things down as its own sales were dragging. So the ovens were scrapped and McDonalds turned its sights on other gimmicky productions — like the Arch Deluxe which I think we can blame for Jessica Biel becoming a thing
2209,Some birds want the whole package. None more so than a particularly demanding Snowy Owl in Poland who KILLED her new boyfriend because of his tiny penis. The bird nicknamed the Black Widow left her suitor half eaten shocking vets at the animal shelter in Knyszynska Forest. Park keepers had noticed the owl was unhappy and decided to pair her up with a new mate. But just two days after arriving from Germany they found the new owl devoured and dead. Shelter spokesman Robert Konowal said The first two days were fine and they seemed to get on very well. We were horrified when we then discovered she had killed him. At first we could not understand why but we took the remains to a vet who after examining him found that his testicle sack and private parts were underdeveloped. In other words he was not a suitable lover and we assume that after failing to perform she killed him probably out of frustration. GettyA lonely female owl was introduced to a male suitor. She killed him because his penis was not big enoughMurderer The lonely female owl killed her mate because his penis was not big enough The Snowy Owl is beautiful but also brutal and we have nicknamed her the Black Widow. The zoo confirmed that they were now looking for another snowy owl to be provided but said so far other facilities were reluctant to accommodate the request after the way the owls last partner ended up. Konowal added She may be a bit fussy but we are sure there is another owl out there who will meet her standards. Click below to see some cute animals who got along much better than these owls
326,Britain said on Saturday it was investigating reports that a man believed to be a British national suspected of carrying out beheadings in videos released by Islamic State had been wounded in a US led air strike last week. The man dubbed Jihadi John by the British media was believed to have been injured in an air attack on a summit of IS leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last Saturday Britains Mail on Sunday newspaper reported. The groups leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was also said to have been wounded in the attack the paper added. We are aware of reports a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said. We can not confirm these reports. A speech purporting to be by Baghdadi was released on Thursday following contradictory accounts out of Iraq that he had been wounded last Friday in US air strikes. US officials said on Tuesday they could not confirm whether Baghdadi was hit in a strike near Falluja in Iraq. According to the Mail on Sunday which said its source was an unnamed nurse Jihadi John Baghdadi and other wounded IS figures were taken to hospital and then driven to the Syrian city of Raqqa. The paper said it was not clear how serious their injuries were. In videos released by Islamic State the masked black clad militant brandishing a knife and speaking with an English accent appears to have carried out the beheadings of two Americans and two Britons
448,Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner wants to put an end to werewolf bar mitzvahs once and for all. Kirchner adopted Argentinian teen Yair Tawil as her godson as part of a folktale that says the seventh born son in a family will turn into a werewolf and eat unbaptized babies the New York Daily News reports. This may sound familiar to fans of 30 Rock Source YouTube Wait what. According to Argentinian folklore the seventh son born to a family turns into the feared el lobizon the Independent explains. The werewolf like beast shows its true nature on the first Friday after boys 13th birthday the legend says turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form. The legend seems ridiculous but the Independent reports that fear of the creature was so widespread in 19th century Argentina that some families even murdered their babies. Fear and panic gave rise to the unusual practice of adoption by Argentinas president in 1907 which is meant to quell the deadly stigma ad demystify the folklore that was causing the abuse of children. Now a time honored tradition any family with seven sons or daughters today gets the president as their official godparent a gold medal and a full educational scholarship. The boys parents Shlomo and Nehama Tawil had written the presidents office requesting the adoption in 1993 the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported. President Kirchner reportedly described the adoption as a magical moment calling the Tawils a marvelous family. But are they more marvelous than this. Source Giphy ht New York Daily News

Right now doctors are scheduling surgery to save its life. FOX 13 visited Bart on Monday. Rescuers say they believe he may have regained consciousness dug himself out of the ground and hid for a few days. I do not know about you guys but personally I like my Florida stories when they are not literally the plot of a Stephen King novel. Bart is expected to make a full recovery but as if you needed more reason to stay away from Florida there is now a zombie cat on the loose.

Some sites are treating it as if a pranksters hidden camera actually caught a man hollering at his moms tasty panties but if the scene seems totally staged that is because it was. The Whistling at Your Mom ad actually debuted in Peru back in November on the heels of the viral 10 Hours Walking as a Woman in New York City that made street harassment a worldwide hot topic. The original Spanish language video has been viewed more than 5 million times. A reuploaded translated version hit Reddit this week bringing the PSA to English speaking audiences. When the video first debuted Spanish newspaper El País reported that the whole scene was staged with actors but the story was based on interviews with real subjects who once harassed female relatives by mistake and expressed deep shame. According to internet hoax busting compendium Emergentinfo Peruvian business newspaper Gestion also called the video out as a scripted setup writing Speaking about the narrative aspect it is obvious the situations had been staged. We do understand it would be difficult to go with real interactions but it is also obvious they wanted us to believe they were real when they are not. it is basically a funnier tamer version of the hoax video from last November that showed men on Hollywood Boulevard trying to take advantage of a drunk woman. At least the actors knew what they were getting into in this one. That Viral Video of Creeps Hitting on a Drunk Woman Was Just a Hoax A social experiment where a woman pretended to be drunk on Hollywood Boulevard while… Read more gawker​com Although these gullible harassers did not actually have the tables turned on them by their own moms— tasty panties god how embarrassing—the point of the video still stands Would you treat your mother like that. The debate about whether setups like this do more harm than good in attempting to end catcalling—some people use them to disingenuously argue that street harassment itself is a fiction—continues

After Chan Chun Chee was caught red handed by the women whose underwear had gone missing they forced him to wear one of the pilfered bras and made him walk around the block in a classic example of public shaming.

1782,POLICE are investigating claims a doctor took a selfie with Joan Rivers while she was unconscious on the operating table before performing a biopsy she had not consented to. The shocking claim was made by a staff member at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic where Rivers underwent a routine throat procedure on August 28. After complications the 81 year old comedian was rushed to hospital where she died a week later. SHOCK LOSS Joan Rivers dead at 81 Investigators are looking in to claims that a second unnamed doctor entered the operating room after that initial procedure to conduct a biopsy on her vocal chords. They are also probing claims by the staff member that the clinician who performed the biopsy first snapped a photo of himself with the sedated star. FOND FAREWELL Star studded send off at Joan Rivers funeral CNN cited a source close to the investigation as saying that the vocal chord biopsy was not something Rivers had consented to.

1953,Hewlett Packard said it would split into two listed companies separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster growing corporate hardware and services operations. HP said its shareholders would own a stake in both businesses through a tax free transaction next year. Shares of the company which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing rose almost 8 percent in premarket trading on Monday. Each of the two businesses contribute about half of HPs current revenue and profit. The move will result in a monumental reshaping of one of technologys most important pioneers which still has more than 300000 employees and is on track to book 112 billion in revenue this fiscal year. The printing and personal computing business to be known as HP Inc will be led by Dion Weisler currently an executive in that division. HPs current chief executive Meg Whitman will lead the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise which will house the corporate hardware and services operations. She will also be chairman of HP Inc Current HP lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company. Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a Palo Alto California garage in 1939 HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the PC revolution. Lately however it has struggled to adapt to the shift toward mobile computing and it has been overshadowed by younger rivals. The announcement on Monday confirmed a report of the split in the Wall Street Journal on Sunday. HP is the latest in a line of companies often under shareholder pressure to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and to capitalize on faster growing businesses. Last week online auction company eBay said it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal. Up to Fridays close HPs stock had risen nearly 26 percent this year
2566,With an unanticipated coup de théâtre Donald Trump fired FBI director James Comey yesterday. Comey learned of his dismissal from cable news reports while at an event on talent acquisition and diversity at the FBI. It was so unexpected that the former FBI director apparently thought it was a joke. According to the official version of what transpired the Trump administration decided to fire Comey in large part because of his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clintons emails. But the fact that Comey was in charge of investigating potential ties between the Trump administration and Russia seems too coincidental to overlook. Many pundits have also pointed out the parallels between Trumps decision and president Richard Nixons notorious Saturday Night Massacre when Nixon fired the special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal. Trumps administration has already weathered its fair share of scandals. The maelstrom of media coverage and the confusing and contradictory explanations offered by Trump aides can make it difficult to discern which stories are actually problematic and which are more smoke than fire. So how big a deal is Comeys firing. To gauge this we first need to know the real reasons motivating Trump and his attorney general. With the administration sticking to its story—for now—here is a ranking of possible scenarios Trump fired Comey because his mistakes made the FBI look bad Ranking Easy D On May 8 Comey testified in front of the Senate judiciary committee. During this appearance he said that HillaryClintons top aide Huma Habedin had forwarded hundreds and thousands of emails to her husband Anthony Weiner some of which were classified—so that Weiner could print them out. That claim turned out to be incorrect. According to the White House it was also the last straw Comey had mishandled the Clinton investigation since the very beginning the administration used this last mistake as a reason to finally pull the plug on him. If plain incompetence is indeed the real reason behind Comeys firing it would represent the least concerning scenario. As Quartz has already pointed out the decision could have been managed more elegantly and the timing is bizarre as most of Comeys alleged mistakes happened months ago. Then again delayed firings are one of Trumps specialities. The silver lining. If Trump is truly committed to investigating Russias alleged meddling—and this is a huge hypothetical if—he may be more likely to appoint an independent special prosecutor to pick up Comeys investigation. Trump fired Comey because he would not investigate wiretapping at Trump Tower Ranking Sad. Trump is a master conspiracy theorist especially when it comes to the circumstances of his own election. Whether claiming Clinton benefited from millions of illegal votes or arguing with the National Parks Service over the crowd at his inauguration Trump by his own admission believes the truth is not absolute. One of Trumps strongly held opinions is the unproven claim that president Obama tapped his phones during the campaign. Relatedly it is possible that when Comey refused to substantiate the conspiracy the president grew increasingly frustrated and eventually decided to cook up an excuse to get rid of the FBI director. Comeys bungled testimony regarding the Clinton emails represented the perfect opportunity. A vindictive president who believes in alternative facts and does not like being questioned is an unpredictable president. Partisanship is bad enough—presidents should not allow their personal biases to dictate policy and professional duties. Trump fired Comey because of the Russia investigation Ranking Total disaster. But what if Trump was truly attempting to use his executive powers to halt an investigation and potentially enable a cover up. This is the worst case scenario. Comey was reportedly expanding the investigation into Russias alleged involvement in the 2016 presidential election. In this last and most troubling scenario Trump eager to hinder the FBIs search—or simply wishing to avoid a prolonged PR disaster—instructed his staff to find an excuse no matter how old to cut the head off the proverbial snake. Attorney general Jeff Sessions who had publicly recused himself from the Russia investigation was involved in the decision of removing Comey and will be involved in choosing the next FBI director. If impeding the FBIs investigation really was the objective Trump will now be able to select a prosecutor friendly to the White House. Whoever is selected will also have their predecessors fate as a reminder of what happens to directors who dare challenge the president. In such a scenario it is also unlikely the attorney general would appoint a special prosecutor
1287,Notorious murderer Charles Manson 80 is probably relieved that his jailhouse marriage license expired last week. According to the author of an upcoming book the inmates fiancé Afton Elaine Star Burton 26 only wanted to marry him so that she could display his dead corpse as a tourist attraction after his death. Journalist Daniel Simone author of the upcoming The Retrial of Charles Manson told the New York Post that Burton wanted access to Mansons corpse so that she could display it in public in a glass enclosure after his death in a kind of bizarre California version of Lenins tomb. He finally realized that he is been played for a fool Simone told the Post of Manson who was set to marry Burton after the pair secured a marriage license last year. The wedding had to be scrapped after the 90 day marriage license expired before the couple could tie the knot. However Simone tells the paper that Manson had another perfectly sensible reason for turning Burton down. He feels he will never die Simone said. Therefore he feels it is a stupid idea to begin with. According to the Associated Press Burton left her home in Illinois and moved to Central California to be near California State Prison Corcoran where Manson is incarcerated. Manson and several of his family members were convicted in 1971 for the brutal murders of seven people including Sharon Tate the pregnant wife of director Roman Polanski and married couple Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. Manson was at first sentenced to death but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole when California tossed out the death penalty in 1972. Manson was denied parole for the twelfth time in April 2012. He will next be eligible in 2027 when he will be 92 years old
92,An unfortunate woman in South Korea was left in agony after being partially eaten by a robot vacuum cleaner. The Guardian reports that the woman was sleeping on the floor while the autonomous roving vacuum did its job. But disaster struck when her hair became trapped in the mechanism after the machine mistook it for dust. Fortunately the 52 year old woman from Changing City was able to get help in time. The woman was immediately woken by the pain and called the local fire department with what the Yonhap news agency reported as a desperate rescue plea. She was eventually separated from the machine by paramedics and was not seriously injured. Reports say she lost about 10 strands of hair. South Korean newspaper Kyunghyang Shinmun did not report on the specific brand of vacuum involved though another local news source said that since sleeping on the floor is more common in the country people may be at more risk from robotic disaster. Inevitably thoughts here will turn to the inevitable automaton uprising but since the other other violence known to have involved a robot vacuum is one act of suicide we probably do not have too much to worry about

2194,UNITED NATIONS Iraqs ambassador to the United Nations asked the UN Security Council on Tuesday to look at allegations that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria is using organ harvesting as a way to finance its operations. Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim told reporters that in the past few weeks bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys or other body parts have been found in shallow mass graves. We have bodies. Come and examine them he said. It is clear they are missing certain parts. Play VIDEO New photo of ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi He also said a dozen doctors have been executed in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting. Alhakim briefed the council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused ISIS of crimes of genocide in targeting certain ethnic groups. The outgoing UN envoy to Iraq Nikolay Mladenov told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict. Mladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that ISIS is using organ harvesting as a financing method but he said only that it is very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day. He used an alternative acronym for the group. Play VIDEO Egypt takes on ISIS with airstrikes He said Iraqs most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that ISIS has seized in the past year. The Sunni militants seized a third of both Iraq and neighboring Syria and imposed strict Sharia law. Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control Mladenov said. Sheikh Ahmed Aburisha is a tribal leader from Anbar province in Iraq 85 percent of which is under ISIS control. In late January he visited Washington to urge the US to give his tribes weapons and money so they can defeat ISIS in Anbar. Vice President Biden and Gen John Allen have a clear picture of what is happening in Iraq and Anbar and what type of support is needed for the fighters in Anbar Aburisha told CBS News Jennifer Janisch. We have received promises and we hope that these promises will materialize in reality on the ground

We were committed to fight until the last bullet. She added that the combats zone was strewn with Taliban bodies when the fighting was over. A spokesman for the Afghanistans Ministry of Interior told the agency it was a symbol of a public uprising. The Taliban is yet to comment about the incident. Alongside other insurgent groups the Taliban have escalated attacks across the country since the withdrawal of most of the US led forces from the country last month. Targeting government security and foreign installations especially in the countrys capital Kabul members of the public have also been caught in the crossfire. At least 50 people were injured earlier this week when a suicide bomber detonated his explosive vest in a crowd watching a volleyball tournament at an inter district competition in Yahyakahil Paktika province. The attacks have prompted Afghanistans president Ashraf Ghani to order a comprehensive review of the countrys defense forces. He is also rethinking Afghan policy towards controversial night raids banned by his predecessor Hamid Karzai. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has ordered a top to bottom inspection of his countrys military forces after a rise in Taliban attacks Ghani is considering whether night raids barred by his predecessor Hamid Karzai should be reintroduced The latest attacks come as it was revealed US President Barack Obama signed a secret order allowing the Pentagon to continue to target Taliban fighters even after the military withdrawal. The presidents decision made during a White House meeting with national security advisers also gives the military the green light to conduct air support for Afghan operations when needed. Obama issued the guidelines in recent weeks as the American combat mission in Afghanistan draws to a close thousands of troops return home and the military prepares for narrower counter terrorism and training mission for the next two years. Afghan lawmakers have also approved agreements with the US and NATO allowing Western soldiers to remain in the country.

2429,BUTTE Montana Robert ONeill the former United States Navy SEAL who shot and killed Osama Bin Laden had his home mistakenly invaded by members of a street gang this morning shortly after 1AM. ONeill was uninjured the five intruders all suffered injuries and remain hospitalized but are expected to make a full recovery. Their names were not released in anticipation of the oncoming media storm. Butte Police Commissioner Bartholomew S Harrington told members of the Associated Press in a brief press conference that the five men part of a local street gang connected with the infamous Crips were seeking to collect on a drug debt and invaded the wrong house with the intended target just so happening to be the next door neighbor of ONeills. Mr ONeill had just turned in for the night but was awoken by a loud crash when his backdoor was abruptly kicked in. As the five thugs ran aimlessly through the home Mr ONeill used silent hand to hand combat tactics to individually disarm them of their weapons. Once Mr ONeill had taken down the five men and secured his home he brewed a pot of coffee and called the police station. Those boys sure did find the wrong house. commissioner Harrington said as he chuckled. ONeill had little to say on the matter when Butte Daily Times journalist Kevin Williamson interviewed the celebrated war hero. It was nothing really. Those kids did not have their mission planned out properly and hit the wrong target. I hated to break their wrists and dislocate each of their knees like I did but it was necessary in order to immobilize the invasion. I hope they get the money that is owed to them once they get out of jail and decide to live better lives. My main concern is getting my back door fixed. Those boys really did a number on the door jamb ONeill stated. The neighbor who was the intended target seems to have abandoned home and has not been found by police. According to the men in custody the debt was over a 50 bag of marijuana
1992,Charles Mansons fiancée allegedly tricked him into agreeing to marry her as part of a bizarre plot to put his corpse on display after he died. Afton Elaine Burton who calls herself Star took out a marriage license with the serial killer last year but reportedly only suggested matrimony to get legal ownership of his remains and stuff them in a glass coffin. Star 27 strung the 80 year old murderer along with the hope of cashing in after he died and turning his body into a tourist attraction according to a source close to Manson. She had already tried to get the rights to his remains without marrying him but was turned down according to the New York Post. The paper claimed that Star offered herself up as a his bride after being rebuffed because Californian law allows spouses to choose what happens to their husbands and wives bodies after they die. The claims come from Daniel Simone a journalist who has spoken extensively with Manson and is planning to write a book on him. He claimed that Manson is now wise to the plot and thinks it is ridiculous because he believes that he is immortal. Simone told the Post he is finally realized that he is been played for a fool. He feels he will never die. Therefore he feels it is a stupid idea to begin with. Simone also said that Manson never had any intention of marrying Star but he kept up the pretense because they would bring presents to his prison cell in Corcoran California. The prospect of Star becoming Mrs Manson diminished this week after it emerged the couples 90 day marriage license had expired. Killer Manson is pictured left during his trial in March 1971 and of right in a mugshot taken on March 18 2009 at California State Prison Corcoran Prison rules mean the two could only marry during visiting hours on a weekend and last weekend was their final shot before the license expired on 5 February. Simone said that Manson has been unable to receive visitors lately because he is being treated for an infection. In a statement Star has said she an Manson will still marry but that an interruption in logistics got in the way. Manson has been in prison for more than four decades after being put away for a series of murders in 1969 killings. His victims included the brutal murder of director Roman Polanskis actress wife Sharon Tate who was eight and a half months pregnant. Star insisted last year that she and Manson were madly in love and already consider themselves married. I am completely with him and he is completely with me. it is what I was born for you know. I do not know what else to say she told CNN in August of the now gray haired killer who has a swastika tattooed on his forehead. She said she had been following Mansons philosophy since she was a teenager and moved to Corcoran where the convicted murderer is detained to be closer to him. Manson was married twice before he was jailed first to Rosalie Jean Willis from 1955 to 1958 and later to Candy Stevens between 1959 and 1963. He was sentenced to death in 1969 along with four of his disciples for having led the killing of seven people but their sentences were later commuted to life in prison. Manson applied for parole in 2012 but was denied release and is not eligible to apply again until 2027. Manson headed an apocalyptic cult that committed murders in upscale mostly white neighborhoods of Los Angeles in order to blame the crimes on African Americans in the hope of sparking what he termed a Helter Skelter race war
100,The answer is no absolutely not. Well… sort of. Related High School Investor My Story — And Millions — Are A Complete Lie. Argentinas President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner just took on Iair Tawil as a godson. True. Thing is Iair is a 21 year old son of a rabbi and now Argentinas first Jewish presidential godson even though he is not a baby and is at no risk of becoming a lycanthrope. Apparently several news agencies which we will not be making fun of for reporting something so ridiculous claimed that the president adopted a baby to keep it from becoming a werewolf. In Argentina the legend of the lobizón is similar to the standard werewolf legend. Basically in the Argentinian legend the seventh son of a seventh son was suuuuuper susceptible to becoming a werewolf. what is funny is this apparently has nothing to do with the Argentinian tradition of the seventh son of a family being eligible to become the Presidents godchild. That tradition was apparently brought over by Russian immigrants in 1907. President Fernández is already godmother to around 700 children after taking office in 2007. Regardless it is still pretty cute this 21 year old man became her godson. We love they are all lighting a menorah too seeing as how only Christian babies used to be eligible to become presidential godchildren. we are glad times are changing. And REALLY glad werewolves do not exist. LOLz
1793,Hewlett Packard is officially splitting in two. Following rumors over the weekend HP is announcing today that it will separate its PC and printer division from its enterprise and services business. The split means current CEO Meg Whitman will become the chairman of the PC and printer operation and continue as CEO of the split off enterprise business. Dion Weisler an executive at HPs PC business will take over as CEO of the companys PC and printer operation. HP Enterprise is the newly split off part of the original company and HP Inc will continue to focus on PCs and printers. The decision to separate into two market leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan says HP CEO Meg Whitman. It will provide each new company with the independence focus financial resources and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics while generating long term value for shareholders. HP is planning to complete the split by the end of fiscal 2015 and the structure will mean the companys total planned layoffs will rise to 55000 from an earlier estimate of 45000 to 50000 cuts. Todays split is a significant change for the company following rumors from 2011 that HP was considering a similar split at the time. Those reports surfaced shortly before HP appointed Meg Witman as CEO just 11 months after former CEO Leo Apotheker took over from Mark Hurd after he was forced to resign amidst charges of inappropriate business conduct. Apotheker spearheaded a disastrous acquisition of Autonomy and failed to capitalize on the companys purchase of webOS. Whitmans era at HP has seen the company struggle to cement a solid position in the industry leaving Lenovo to dominate PC sales worldwide. Whitmans initial assessment of the company after around six months left her feeling it was too complex and too slow noting it had underinvested in its PC division. Instead of significant investment Whitman claimed in 2012 that the company had to offer a smartphone before failing to announce one in 2013. Board members reportedly mulled spinning off the companys consumer PC business in 2013 but it never happened. HP has recently focused on Android tablets and even an Android laptop after describing Microsoft as an outright competitor. HP and Microsoft appear to be forming a closer relationship with the launch of new low cost Stream PCs. Although Lenovo continues to push Windows based PCs Microsoft still needs close PC allies as it demonstrated with a 2 billion loan to help Dell go private last year. That particular deal may have angered HP but the renewed partnership will see Microsoft and HP take on Chromebooks this holiday season. HP is also planning to sell a smartwatch this fall. A new HP says it will focus on new computing experiences and technologies like 3D printing. As the market leader in printing and personal systems an independent HP Inc will be extremely well positioned to deliver that innovation across our traditional markets as well as extend our leadership into new markets like 3 D printing and new computing experiences inventing technology that empowers people to create interact and inspire like never before says Dion Weisler head of HPs Printing and Personal Systems business
2331,Production is gearing up for the upcoming launch of the Apple Watch according to a fresh report from Digitimes. Industry sources indicate that as many as 40 million units of Apples custom chip have been ordered to prepare for initial shipments. These numbers suggest that the Cupertino tech giant is expecting high global demand for its innovative smartwatch. Along with those high production stats however come potentially high prices for consumers. When the Apple Watch was first revealed in September the base model was announced at a 350 for an aluminum band. This is well over 100 more than similar products from competitors like Sony and Motorola. The ever looming Apple tax does not stop there either. Apple Watch stainless steel bands could start as high as 500 says French Apple blog iGenfr while wealthy buyers hoping to purchase a solid gold band for their Apple smartwatch may have to shell out as much as 5000. French pricing schemes may vary widely from what we see on day one in the United States so the accuracy of these figures is still up for debate. Fans of Apple products are used to paying higher prices for premium goods and that trend seems to be alive and well in the companys latest product. For those wondering when the Apple Watch hits store shelves a recent rumor report from Business Insider pegs a release as soon as Valentines Day 2015. That date is supposedly an optimistic one however so officials at Apple are more inclined to stick to a tentative spring 2015 time frame. As production enters its heaviest phases Apple seems ready to tackle the watch industry in full force. What remains to be seen is if the companys first massive chip order will be enough to satisfy consumer demand. Is the Apple Watch high on your wish list. Would you pay thousands of dollars for a top tier band. Tell us your thoughts in the comments
2572,it is been several months since the intelligence community concluded Russia tampered in the election including stealing Democratic Party emails and giving them to WikiLeaks. Yet an unfounded conspiracy theory persists that WikiLeaks actually got the emails from a Democratic National Committee staffer who was shot and killed in July 2016. Seth Rich who worked on voter access projects for the DNC was 27 when he was killed early in the morning near his Washington home. Ten months later the case remains unsolved though Washington police have said they believe it was likely a botched robbery. WikiLeaks published tens of thousands of internal DNC emails several days after Rich died leading conspiracy theorists to speculate that the two events were related. WikiLeaks offered a 20000 reward for information about Richs murder. The story is back in the news because on May 15 a private investigator looking into Richs case said he had evidence to prove the theorists right. But the investigator a man named Rod Wheeler backtracked on his claims the next day and the Rich family has sent him a cease and desist letter saying their son was not WikiLeaks source. Even so some right wing pundits continue to peddle this conspiracy most prominently on Fox News. Among them are host Sean Hannity and former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich. We have this very strange story now of this young man who worked for the Democratic National Committee who apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning having given WikiLeaks something like 53000 emails and 17000 attachments Gingrich said on Fox May 21. Nobodys investigating that and what does that tell you about what was going on. Because it turns out it was not the Russians. Contrary to Gingrichs statement the thin case that Rich was the DNC leaker is in no way substantial enough to outweigh ample evidence that Russia was the culprit. Two days after Gingrich made this claim Fox News retracted its report promoting this conspiracy theory. Scant evidence that Seth Rich leaked the emails The latest iteration of this story started when Wheeler spoke to a reporter with Washington local news station WWTG TV on May 15. Wheeler worked for the Washington police in the 1990s and is an occasional Fox News contributor. Texas businessman Ed Butowsky another Fox News contributor is financing Wheelers investigation. Wheeler told WWTG TV he believes the local police and the FBI are engaged in a cover up because of information found on Richs laptop and the relationship between the Washington mayors office and the DNC. But you have sources at the FBI saying there is information that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks. asked the WTTG TV reporter. Absolutely Wheeler replied. Yeah and that is confirmed. The next day a national Fox News report said an unnamed federal investigator corroborated Wheelers findings. And according to the federal investigator an FBI analysis of Richs laptop found that Rich made contact with a WikiLeaks director and sent him 44053 emails and 17761 attachments from DNC leaders. Heres the problem Hours after Fox published its report Wheeler recanted. He told CNN that he had not seen the evidence himself and his knowledge of Richs alleged email contact with WikiLeaks came from the national Fox News reporter not his own investigative work. Let me just really quickly say this Wheeler said on Hannitys show May 16. I do not know for sure I do not know as a matter of fact if the emails went out to the WikiLeaks or anybody else but it sure appears that way. Fox retracted its own May 16 article saying the article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting. So this allegation that Rich was the real DNC leaker — and related insinuation that Rich was murdered because of it — rests nearly entirely on claims from a single unnamed federal investigator with unspecified connections to the case. The theory also does not make much logical sense. No evidence has emerged that shows Rich was so disgruntled with the DNC that he felt the need to expose its leaders to WikiLeaks. Further the leaked emails were overall rather mild. They were embarrassing and prompted Rep Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida to step down from her role as DNC chair but they did not expose any conspiracies or illegal activity. All of this together makes for a pretty flimsy case especially when compared to the broad consensus that Russian actors were the true culprit. Lots of evidence Russia stole then leaked the emails The intelligence community and private cybersecurity professionals have widely concluded that the DNC hack and WikiLeaks dump are covered in Russian fingerprints. The technical methods behind the hack were similar to those used by two Russian intelligence groups dubbed APT28 and APT29 also known as Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear. And experts have said that dumping large quantities of stolen political information is a signature move of Russian influence operations. there is also the fact that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and the Russian government have a well documented relationship. Assange has hosted a television show on RT a state owned network for example. Various intelligence agencies reiterated Russias culpability in official reports in October December and January. And intelligence community leaders and experts in Russia and cybersecurity have said they agreed with this conclusion in testimony before Congress in the months since. The final piece of Russias modern Active Measures surfaced in the summer of 2016 as hacked materials were strategically leaked said Clint Watts senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and former FBI special agent in a March 30 Senate hearing. The disclosures of WikiLeaks Guccifer 20 and DC Leaks demonstrated how hacks would power the influence system Russia had built so successfully in the previous two years. there is evidence that Russia engaged in cyber operations against Republicans too though it was not as robust as the DNC hack. The Russians used cyber operations against both political parties including hacking into servers used by the Democratic National Committee and releasing stolen data to WikiLeaks and other media outlets said former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper in a May hearing. Russia also collected on certain Republican Party affiliated targets but did not release any Republican related data. Our ruling Gingrich said DNC staffer Seth Rich apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning having given WikiLeaks something like 53000 emails and 17000 attachments. . It turns out it was not the Russians. There is no trustworthy evidence supporting the theory that Rich was WikiLeaks source for thousands of DNC emails. The police believe his death was the result of a botched robbery not a political assassination. The intelligence community and cybersecurity experts have reached a broad conclusion that all the available evidence points to Russia as the actual perpetrators — based on technical indicators and an understanding of how Russian influence operations work. Gingrich and others are talking about an unfounded conspiracy theory as if it is a matter of fact. It is far from it. We rate his claim Pants on Fire
1937,Despite a wild report on a website dedicated to conspiracy theories local soldiers have not lost a low yield nuclear weapon. As the lockdown of soldiers in a Fort Carson battalion dragged into its fifth day Monday the site Whatdoesitmeancom reported that a nuclear artillery shell was missing an item that has not been in the Army inventory for 22 years. That story was translated into several languages including Russian and spread rapidly on the Internet. Photo The modified M9 Beretta pistol used for the Basic Active Shooter Course fires a powder propelled paint cup to provide the most realistic training possible while maintaining the level of safety required for the scenarios Jan 26. The course is taught by a 4 man training team from the 610th Security Forces Squadron Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth Texas. They came to Dobbins Air Reserve Base to provide this critical training for the 94th Security Forces Squadron and other Dobbins area security personnel. The two day course provides classroom and tactical instruction to first responders covering several shooting spree scenarios. caption Sources at the post told The Gazette that the lockdown involving 100 soldiers from the 1st Battalion of the 66th Armor Regiment is actually for something more mundane a 9 mm pistol. The Army has not officially released details on what spurred the lockdown and search calling it missing government property. The lockdown started with about 800 soldiers confined to the battalions buildings on the post. That was reduced over the weekend to about 100 soldiers a company of troops. Retired Command Sgt. Maj Terrance McWilliams who served as the posts top enlisted soldier said lockdowns are a common practice commanders use to turn up lost gear. I personally went through it as a 1st sergeant and the longest it took was four days said McWilliams. The lockdown was triggered Thursday after the pistol turned up missing in an equipment inventory that followed a training exercise. Post officials ordered a wide search for the missing weapon Thursday including inspecting cars as they exited the post at gates. Retired Command Sgt. Maj John Kurak who also held Fort Carsons top enlisted post said a five day lockdown is not close to a record for Fort Carson. In Fort Carsons history there have been lockdowns that have lasted months Kurak said noting that an infantry battalion on there spent three months on lockdown in the late 1980s after a M 16 rifle was lost. McWilliams said the first step in the search for the weapon likely was quizzing the soldier who checked it out from the unit is armory for the training exercise. The battalions soldiers were returning from a training exercise that spanned a wide swath of the 137000 acre post. When it was determined that the weapon was lost soldiers were likely sent to scouring training areas in a move called hands across Fort Carson that sees soldiers walking shoulder to shoulder to find the missing weapon. When that did not bear fruit soldiers were ordered to remain on duty and on post until the weapon was found a lockdown. Long lockdowns like the one that deprived 1st Battalion soldiers of what was a planned four day weekend do come to an end. Eventually its going to get to the point where they determine the item is actually lost McWilliams said. Then they will determine what actions to take against the person responsible for the item. Losing a weapon can bring stiff consequences in the military where loss or destruction of government property can be charged as a crime bringing up to a year behind bars. The Army spends a lot of time keeping track of pistols rifles and other sensitive items. Every training day begins and ends with a sensitive items check and daily inventories are sent up through the chain of command. If you can not keep track of your equipment how can you be expected to do more complex tasks. Kurak asked. In combat units heading out and returning from stop for a boys and toys check to make sure all weapons night vision goggles laser sights radios and other items are on hand. Accountability of equipment is a basic and essential function of a unit Kurak said. While the battalion may have lost a pistol scores of web pages carried the nuclear weapon tale Monday. That story attributed to unnamed Russian intelligence sources alleged that a 155 mm artillery fired nuclear warhead is missing at the post. The battalion involved though does not have artillery. And the W 48 artillery warhead alleged to be missing was pulled from Army bases worldwide in 1992. While the Pikes Peak region is home to a five military bases it does not house nuclear weapons. The closest nuclear arms are atop Air Force intercontinental ballistic missiles at FE. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne Wyo
328,Last week President Cristina Kirchner adopted a Jewish teenager named Yair Tawil and posted pictures of the event on her Twitter feed. Outlets around the world ran with the story explaining the move by citing lingering local superstition about werewolves. In Western folklore only a werewolf can create another werewolf with its bite but in Argentina the storys a little different the creature is born when a couple gives birth to their seventh son in a row. According to said folklore seventh sons turn into el lobizon on their 13th birthday if nothing is done about the hereditary curse. Thus the need for presidential action is pretty clear. The notion of animal shifting came from different Native American traditions Oscar Chamosa a folklorist at the University of Georgia told me. The idea of el lobison comes from uturunco—or the were jaguar—which mixed with the European notion of the werewolf. Chamosa says he is not sure how the idea was first associated with teenaged boys. But even if someone who is devoted his entire life to studying Argentine folklore can not explain it the teen werewolf thing had become pervasive by the early 20th century and Catholics in Argentina were producing enough seventh children that the myth became a public policy problem. After all terrified parents were regularly committing infanticide. In order to counteract the myth Argentine presidents have traditionally godfathered any child born into the same family Chamosa explains adding that the governor of a province or mayor of a village would sometimes officiate for practical reasons. The rationale is that the godson of a president would be respected throughout his life despite the suspicion his seventh male birth position would bring with it. This idea apparently prevented people from murdering their own babies so it was a smart move on part of the Argentine government. But if it is surprising people believed in such a curse a century ago it is downright bizarre that they are still entertaining the notion of it today. As per a decree that came out in 1973 adoptees receive a gold medal and a college scholarship. And Argentina is apparently still making new rules about werewolf children because in 1999 the adoption ceremony was extended to non Catholics. As the Independent noted Tawil is the first Jewish boy to receive the honor. So while a werewolf Bar Mitzvah might be a joke on 30 Rock it is also apparently a real thing that just happened in South America. The boys parents first applied for the medal and scholarship in 1993 but were denied. They applied again after the rules changed to include Jews in 2009. A tweet from President Kirchners account shows her lighting a menorah with the Tawils quite the gesture given that the Jewish population of Argentina is less than half of one percent. Jewishpublications are making a big deal out of the historic event and angry commenters are freaking out about a Jew being adopted—even symbolically—by a non Jew and the blasphemous concept of a Jewish family taking part in something involving werewolves. But most observers have been glossing over the absolutely fucking strange juxtaposition between a groundbreaking event and an ancient superstition. Like for instance that is it is kind of a weird move to progressively bequeath a privilege to a religious minority while tacitly legitimizing the belief that human beings have the ability to transform into mythical creatures that feast on unbaptized babies. Stories about the adoption would also have us believe the president of an industrialized nation believes in werewolves which is clearly not the case. Although presidents in our own countrys recent memory believed they were chosen by God Chamosa describes Argentinas Kirchner as a nominal Catholic who is a progressive left wing president—more like a Marxist and a secular person in general. Much as our Dear Leader pardons a turkey every year this is an Argentine ritual that is basically a national inside joke. Chamosa says that the werewolf thing has stuck around out of quaint tradition and that the average family in the country today has only two children. For that reason anyone who achieves an unbroken chain of seven same sex children is rewarded with the prize. Of course that does not mean there are not some people in Latin America who still believe in el lobizon. Belief in the healing powers of folk saints and withcraft are pretty much shared across the territory especially—but not only—in rural areas Chamosa says. I would say that only old people still believe in el lobison. But you really do not know. Follow Allie Conti on Twitter
1879,Rumors swirled over the weekend that demonstrators in Hong Kong were using the hands up do not shoot gesture in solidarity with protesters in Ferguson Missouri. On Sunday Vox published a story headlined Hong Kongs protesters are using the same hands up do not shoot gesture used in Ferguson. Pro democracy protestersput their hands up in the air in fron of the police in Hong Kong on September 28 2014. While the article did note that it is impossible to say the degree to which protesters are using the gesture as a deliberate nod to Ferguson it concluded contending that it is fascinating to see a symbol of the fight against racism and police violence in America become a symbol of democracy and freedom halfway around the world however it got there. Other similar stories followed soon after. MSNBC published an article Monday titled In Hong Kong protesters say hands up do not shoot. The Daily Mail published a story saying that protesters in Hong Kong had copied the gesture used by US demonstrators. But a story in Quartz Sunday appeared to challenge the idea that the gesture used by Hong Kong demonstrators was linked to Ferguson. According to the story the gesture used by those in Hong Kong was not a deliberate show of solidarity Most Hong Kong protesters are not purposefully mimicking hands up do not shoot as some have suggested. Instead the gesture is a result of training and instructions from protest leaders who have told demonstrators to raise their hands with palms forward to signal their peaceful intentions to police. Asked about any link between the gesture and Ferguson Icy Ng a 22 year old design student at Hong Kong Polytechnic University said I do not think so. We have our hands up for showing both the police and media that we have no weapons in our hands. Ng had not heard of the Ferguson protests. Another demonstrator with the pro democracy group Occupy Central Ellie Ng said the gesture had nothing to do with Ferguson and is intended to demonstrate that Hong Kong protesters are peaceful unarmed and mild. The Washington Post followed up Monday with a similar analysis Sunday Max Fisher wrote a story for Voxcom arguing that the hands up do not shoot gesture had spread from protests in Ferguson to the pro democracy demonstrations on the streets of Hong Kong. However another writer at Quartzcom who has actually interviewed protesters says that this is wrong. The evidence seems to show that the gesture had probably not in fact spread as Fisher and other commentators believed. Instead the activists organizing the protests appear to have independently chosen to hold their hands up to emphasize their peaceful intentions to police. Vox later corrected their post addressing the controversy. Still Hong Kongers pride themselves on being plugged in to the world so it is within the realm of possibility that some of them followed the events in Ferguson and are now appropriating the gesture for their own use even if only subconsciously their story now argues. — Follow Oliver Darcy on Twitter
1842,UNITED NATIONS – Iraqs ambassador to the United Nations asked the UN Security Council on Tuesday to look at allegations that the Islamic State group is using organ harvesting as a way to finance its operations. Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim told reporters that in the past few weeks bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys or other body parts have been found in shallow mass graves. We have bodies. Come and examine them he said. It is clear they are missing certain parts. He also said a dozen doctors have been executed in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting. Alhakim briefed the council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused the Islamic State group of crimes of genocide in targeting certain ethnic groups. The outgoing UN envoy to Iraq Nikolay Mladenov told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict. Mladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that the Islamic State group is using organ harvesting as a financing method but he said only that it is very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day. He used an acronym for the group. He said Iraqs most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that the Islamic State group has seized in the past year. The Sunni militants seized a third of both Iraq and neighboring Syria and imposed strict Sharia law. Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control Mladenov said
1525,Late comedians personal physician allegedly performed an unauthorized biopsy causing a heart attack Joan Rivers personal doctor took a selfie in the operating room while performing an unauthorized throat biopsy during the procedure that led to the comedians death according to CNN report on Tuesday. A staff member at Manhattans Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators that the doctor who has not been publicly identified took a selfie photo in the procedure room while Rivers was under anesthesia an unnamed source close to the death investigation told the cable news network. However the clinic has denied previous media accounts of the spontaneous biopsy. A biopsy of the vocal cords has never been performed at Yorkville Endoscopy a rep told The Hollywood Reporter in a statement on Sept 12. Yorkvilles medical director Lawrence B Cohen has been forced out of his position on the board and is no longer performing procedures there. He also left his private practice group New York Gastroenterology Associates. Rivers went to Yorkville Endoscopy for a routine procedure when complications arose. She was rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. Rivers died on Sept 4 at age 81. After an initial autopsy the New York City medical examiners office has said the cause of death is unclear and they need to run more tests. Yorkville Endoscopy Dr Cohens office and the medical examiners office did not immediately return emails for comment
2008,A RESPECTED senior French police officer investigating the Charlie Hebdo magazine massacre took his own life mere hours after the horrific attacks stunned the world. Commissioner Helric Fredou 45 turned a gun on himself in his police office in Limoges last Wednesday night reported France 3. A colleague found his body at 1am on Thursday the day after three gunmen fired at the satirical magazines office and left 12 people dead. Speaking to our sister publication Mirror Online the Union of Commissioners of the National Police confirmed Mr Fredou had taken his own life. In a statement released after his death a union spokesman said It is with great sadness that we were informed this morning of the death of our colleague Helric Fredou assigned as Deputy Director of the Regional Service Judicial Police in Limoges. On this particular day of national mourning police commissioners are hit hard by the tragic death of one of their own. The Union of Commissioners of the National Police would like to present its most sincere condolences to the relatives of Helric. In these difficult times we have a special thought for all his colleagues. Mr Fredou who was single and had no children began his career as a police officer in 1997 working in Versailles. He eventually returned to his home town of Limoges and in 2012 became deputy director of the regional police service. French media reports suggest he was depressed and was suffering from burnout. Brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi launched last Wednesdays devastating attack at the offices of the French satirical magazine. The attack left 12 people dead. On Friday the pair were shot dead by police after taking a man hostage at a family run printing press in Dammartin en Goele. In a separate incident on Friday Amedy Coulibaly 32 took about 15 people hostage in a Paris supermarket. Four hostages were killed in the incident along with Coulibaly
2245,A giant crab photographed in a harbour mouth in Kent UK is proving a great drawcard… for the website that is claiming it is a giant crab. Weird Whitstable curator Quinton Winter believes he lives in the UKs weirdest town and hosts a collection of pics and reports on his website to prove it. But even he could not believe this aerial photograph of a 50 foot crab lurking in the shallows off the harbour Crab sandbank or Photoshopping idiot. Picture Weird Whitstable So he went to check it out for himself. At first all I could see was some faint movement then as it rose from the water I thought that is a funny looking bit of driftwood Winter said. It had glazed blank eyes on stalks swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws. Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd shaped sand bank. Now I know better. Oh internet. As great as it would be for this to be genuine we are counting down to the hoax bust in 3… 2… 1… but secretly hoping it is real

2396,The Apple Watch will go on sale in March and though component shortages may be an issue about 5 million of the devices are likely to be sold in the first quarter according to KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo. Apple has not given a launch date for its first smartwatch which it unveiled in September only saying to expect the device in early 2015. In addition to Kuos research note however other reports also have said the watch will be generally available in March. Before the device becomes available Apple will reveal additional information on the watch including battery specifics and pre order details said Kuo according to a story on the website MacRumors. Apple has said the smartwatch will need nightly recharging but has not offered other battery information. Component issues may cause supply problems for the watch Kuo said. Even with possible component shortages Apple will sell 28 million Apple Watches in March and go on to sell 5 million devices in the first quarter of 2015 he said. Kuo called for iPhone shipments for that quarter to exceed 61 million units and iPad shipments to come in at 10 million units. Apple will also launch a 12 inch MacBook Air that quarter said Kuo. The ultra thin notebook will run Intels Core M chip and feature the high resolution Retina display

I was NOT taking sic advantage of by Bill Cosy when I was on The Cosby Show. she wrote in an Instagram post on Wednesday. I was practically a baby on that show and this is truly a disgusting rumor that I want no part of. Everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness she wrote. Now keep me out of this. Cosbys supporters have been few and far between amid the growing chorus of allegations. As Radar has reported he is taking a hit to his career as well with NBC scrapping their planned sitcom with him and Netflix postponing a planned stand up special with the comedian. Story developing
733,THIS seaside town might be famed for its oysters but this incredible image could soon have visitors flocking to Whistable in the hope of catching Britains biggest crab. The photograph which has been shared online appears to show a crustacean that is at least 15 metres wide lurking in shallow water. While some insist it is proof of Crabzilla others argue that the shadowy figure is nothing more than an unusually shaped sandbank — or is simply a playful hoax. The image shows the outline of a crab in the mouth of the Kent harbour — dwarfing the fishing boats resting on the nearby pier. It is shaped like an edible crab a species that is commonly found in British water and grows to an average of five inches. The photograph was posted on a website called Weird Whitstable — an online collection of strange and unusual sightings in the town. Its curator Quinton Winter said that at first he thought the image — sent to him by a follower — showed an unusual sand formation but that he is now convinced it is a monster of the deep. He said At first all I could see was some faint movement then as it rose from the water I thought that is a funny looking bit of driftwood. It had glazed blank eyes on stalks swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws. Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd shaped sand bank. Now I know better. The largest known species of crab is the Japanese spider crab which can measure more than 35 metres. So we are betting this 15 metre crabzilla is the work of one very talented photoshopper
1729,The families of murdered American journalists Jim Foley and Steven Sotloff are speaking out against the US government for making their efforts to free their loved ones a helpless endeavor. The parents of Steven Sotloff a freelance journalist who was kidnapped by militants in Syria told Yahoo News on Friday that a member of the presidents National Security Council threatened them with criminal prosecution if they attempted to pay a ransom to get their son freed. The family felt completely and utterly helpless when they heard this Barak Barfi a friend of Sotloff who is serving as a spokesman for his family told Yahoo News. The Sotloffs felt there was nothing they could do to get Steve out. Sotloffs mother Shirley recorded an emotional video directly addressing ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi in late August. Despite her plea for mercy the group murdered her son one week later. The claim that the government would bring charges against the Sotloff family echoes similar points made in a CNN interview with Jim Foleys mother Diane in which she said she was embarrassed and appalled by the US governments handling of her sons case. In the interview Diane Foley listed things the US government advised the family not to do including not going to the media and not to raise a ransom since it would be illegal — we might be prosecuted Foley said she was told. She also says the government told her it would not exchange prisoners or conduct a military action to go after him. We were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow miraculously she said. And he was not was he. Jim Foley a freelance journalist who was working for GlobalPost in Syria was brutally murdered in mid August soon after the US began airstrikes against ISIS militants in Iraq. It just made me realize that these people talking to us had no idea what it was like to be the family of someone abducted Diane Foley told ABC News. I am sure the US official did not mean it the way he said it but we were between a rock and a hard place. We were told we could do nothing … meanwhile our son was being beaten and tortured every day. The US military attempted a rescue operation in July to find Foley Sotloff and other hostages believed to be held near ISIS de facto capital of Raqqa Syria although the special operations troops were unable to locate any of them. The Wall Street Journal reported the hostages were likely moved as little as 72 hours prior to the raid
133,An Indian bride has married a guest at her wedding after her groom to be had a seizure and collapsed. Reports said the groom Jugal Kishore was epileptic and he had kept the information from the bride Indira and her family. While Mr Kishore was taken to hospital the angry bride decided to switch husbands. She asked a member of her brother in laws family who was a guest to step in and marry her instead. He agreed. The incident took place in Rampur town in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. According to a report in The Times of India Mr Kishore 25 fell to the ground in front of the wedding guests just as he was reaching out to garland Indira. On his return from the hospital Mr Kishore pleaded with Indira to change her mind telling her that he would be ridiculed by friends and relatives if he went home without a bride but she refused. Local police official Ram Khiladi Solanki told the BBC that Mr Kishore and his family were initially upset and lodged a complaint with the police. But since the bride is already married now what can anyone do. So the families have resolved the matter and the complaint has been withdrawn he added

2393,Apple and LG seem to have a trusty healthy relationship on display. Not only has the Korean technological giant outfitted Apples premium iPad tablets with their high resolution displays but the latest word on the subject is that the relationship will continue for the Apple Watch as well. JP Morgan analyst JJ Park claims that LG is the sole supplier of the wearables flexible Plastic OLED screen. LG has been on the forefront of this technology going as far as to produce flexible lighting panels made entirely of plastic. So Apples demands should not be a problem for LGs display arm although it has quite a bit of work cut out for it with Cupertino gearing up to ship 26 to 29 million watches this year and another 61 million next. This will generate billions of dollars of revenue for LG but other analysts think Apple will ship just 85 million watches so let us not juggle the big numbers already. LG aside Apples dream team of component suppliers for the iWatch includes Quanta Samsung ASE Amkor and STATS ChipPAC. This thing packs in much more technology than it seemed at first glance. The Apple Watchs release is expected in April with two different sizes and various price tiers at bay. More news as they come
1811,Last night Pando reported that Apple is about to acquire Path according to a single source in Apples engineering team. We heard second hand that Path is at least in talks with Apple. The idea that an app currently ranked no. 177 in the social networking category on iOS might end up in Apples ion strengthened embrace has left some in the tech community questioning their life choices. What is the point of trying if a Snapchat copying Facebook derivative that followed questionable growth tactics with questionable financing from morally bankrupt Indonesian investors gets to sit in the front row next to Dre. This is not a soft landing they cried this is the ground giving way beneath our feet. Did not forget about Dre. pictwittercomfWNDpFhfYr — Dave Morin September 9 2014 But do not despair fair founders. There are plenty of reasons why this deal is just business as usual in Silicon Valley and not the end of days. 1. Friends Buying Friends Acquisitions tend to be chummy affair. For example Path CEO Dave Morin invested in Hot Potato a company run by his ski buddy Justin Shaffer Morin worked for Facebook Facebook acquired Hot Potato. Karma another Morin investment was also acquired by Facebook. And Dave started his career at Apple helping give out iPods on college campuses. See all in the family. 2. Buying CoolApple which has 150 billion in cash has been proven itself willing to buy new fans before with the Beats acquisition. But Path is the opposite of cool you say. That is true but Morin has proven himself to be a savvy and popular angel investor. In the interest of succession planning a source told Valleywag why would not Apple let Morin rest and vest if it meant young CEOs dropping by Cupertino. he is a good exec he is just a sub par product person. He did well at Apple and Facebook because they had good products added the source. 3. Messaging ManiaSilicon Valley corporations got smoked by Asian messaging apps. People like to communicate with their friends who knew. Pando says that is part of Apples renewed interest in social According to our source this is more than just a talent acquisition or acquihire. The Path product will likely survive the acquisition and be incorporated in whole or in part into Apples newly refreshed Messages app. That does not mean that the deal will be priced like some other recent high profile mobile communication deals namely Facebooks 19 billion Whatsapp acquisition and rumored 3 billion plus offers extended to Snapchat by Facebook and Google. Facebook paid 42 per Whatsapp user and 33 per Instagram user before that. By comparison Rakuten bought the far less beloved Viber for just 3 per user. Perhaps we will hear more about the price tag when Morin takes the stage at TechCrunch Disrupt in less than an hour. 4. No One Even Expects Acquisitions to SucceedSelling out can be a bummer not just for those in golden handcuffs but for the buyers says Pando Apple has not fared much better in the social realm historically having flopped with its Ping social network and having made very little out of its acquisition of the team and IP from failed location based photo social network Color.

1809,The Commissioner of the National Hockey League Gary Bettman has repeatedly insisted that the league is not engaged in an active expansion process but reports insisting otherwise continue to crop up. The latest is from veteran Vancouver Province columnist Tony Gallagher who suggested on Tuesday that the NHL will expand to Las Vegas Nev sooner rather than later Sources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City. Gallagher also insists that there is fire behind all of the NHL related smoke emanating out of Seattle Wash and reports that Vancouver born billionaire Victor Coleman would be among the bidders interested in bringing a second NHL club to the Pacific Northwest. While rumors about Las Vegas expansion continue to swirl to the consternation of players like Chicago Blackhawks nofunnick Jonathan Toews NHL brass has been steadfast in their insistence that nothing is imminent for the league on the expansion front. we are not ready to expand Bettman said in early May addressing rumors of potential NHL expansion in Las Vegas. We as I repeatedly have said have received expressions of interest from people who might want to own a franchise in Las Vegas as we have from a number of other cities but we are not involved in any expansion process.

2539,Eggs are the Dr Jekylll and Mr Hyde of the breakfast world. One day they are a diet darling chockful of healthy fats vitamin E and protein. The next thing you hear Eggs are bad for you—as bad as cigarettes in fact according to a recent study in the journal Atherosclerosis. First heres the deal on that new study. Researchers from Western University in Canada examined over 1200 men and women to come to the conclusion that regularly eating egg yolks was two thirds as bad as smoking when it comes to carotid plaque in the arteries a known risk factor for stroke and heart attack. But before you ditch the eggs experts point out that this study does not exactly give the whole picture. The main crack The research shows an association between egg consumption and plaque buildup rather than a cause and effect relationship says cardiologist Gordon Tomaselli MD from the American Heart Association. The study also did not control for what else participants ate or take into account how much they exercised which can play a big role in heart disease Dr Tomaselli says. While it is interesting that the graphs of egg yolk consumption and smoking take a similar shape when looking at carotid plaque build up this study does not take into account the many other adverse effects of smoking namely high blood pressure and lung cancer says Dr Tomaselli. And your rise and shine scramble has more to it than just cholesterol Eggs contain many other nutrients including unsaturated fats which may be beneficial in preventing cardiovascular disease says Gregg Fonarow MD of UCLA Cardiology. Whether the net effect of egg consumption is beneficial neutral or harmful requires assessing more than just measuring the cholesterol content of egg yolk he says. Here the bottom line on how to eat eggs healthily 1. Skip the three egg omelet. it is safest to limit your egg consumption to one a day. The American Heart Association recommends that most people limit their daily cholesterol intake to 300 milligrams and one yolk contains about 185 milligrams. If a single egg scramble simply will not cut it eat extra whites. This way you will get the protein from the whites without the added cholesterol of the yolk says Dr Tomaselli. 2. Hold the bacon. One of the biggest oversights of this study is that it did not account for the other foods in a persons diet—and anyone who is ever ordered a Grand Slam knows that eggs usually come with side dishes that are not exactly good for you says Marisa Moore RD from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Her advice. Pair your egg with fresh fruit whole grain toast and veggies instead of fennel sausage a greasy hash and bacon. 3. Snack smart. That cookie you have got your eye on. Well that has egg in it too. You have to be cognizant that other dishes contain eggs and cholesterol says Dr Tomaselli. When your next snack attack rolls around reach for a handful of nuts which are rich in heart healthy Vitamin E monounsaturated fats and fiber. 4. Put em out to pasture. It pays to be choosy about which type of eggs you pick up at the supermarket. A 2010 study from Penn State University showed that hens who were kept outside on pastures rather than in a cage laid eggs that had twice as much vitamin E and 25 times the amount of omega 3 fatty acids than the eggs from their cooped up counterparts. To make sure you have got the right ones look for the word pastured on the carton. And as always organic is best

The US and allied forces began launching air strikes against ISIS targets in September. AP

935,Jan Rivers personal ear nose throat doctor took a selfie while the comic was under sedation and began an unplanned biopsy on her vocal cords before the 81 year old went into cardiac arrest CNN reported Tuesday. A staff member at the Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic was the one who told investigators about the picture taking according to a source CNN described as close to the death investigation. The physician has not been identified. The ENT doctors alleged presence in the operating room was first reported last week by the New York Daily News with sources telling the New York Times that he was not authorized to be there. The spur of the moment biopsy caused Rivers vocal cords to seize up in what is called a laryngospasm the Daily News source said. The clinic had countered the biopsy allegation last Wednesday saying in a statement that a biopsy of vocal cords has never been performed at Yorkville Endoscopy adding that although monitored or light to moderate sedation occurred at the clinic general anesthesia was never administered. The statement referred to clinic procedures in general not the Rivers case specifically. Rivers was rushed from the Upper East Side clinic to Manhattans Mt. Sinai Hospital on Aug 28 after she reportedly stopped breathing during the outpatient procedure an upper endoscopy in which a tiny camera was inserted in her throat to examine that part of the digestive system. She did not regain consciousness after arriving at the hospital and daughter Melissa Rivers had her taken off life support on Sept 4. Dr Lawrence B Cohen who according to the CNN source did the upper endoscopy stepped down last week as Yorkville medical director and was no longer performing procedures there a clinic spokeswoman said. The New York State Department of Health has said it is investigating. Follow Christie DZurilla on Twitter theCDZ and Google. Follow the Ministry of Gossip on Twitter LATcelebs
629,9 year old girl has written a hearfelt letter to her teacher after he revealed he was gay during a lesson on homophobic bullying. It reads Dear Mr R Even though you are gay I will always treat you the same way as I do now. I still think about you the same way as I used to. you are a great teacher and these are just some of the words that I would describe you as great amazing fantastic brilliant awesome and brave. The reason why I say brave is because you shared a personal secret which was very brave. You do not have to feel scared because I know that everone in the class feels the same way as I do. From A x x PS. We are all proud of you The teacher told PinkNews As a primary school teacher I had always worried about mentioning my sexuality despite the fact that my colleagues talked about their husbands wives and significant others all the time. ADVERTISEMENT Then as part of anti bullying week I had asked whod heard gay being used as an insult. Almost every one of my class put their hands up. I was stunned. Then I asked who thought that people who were gay or lesbian were bad or wrong in some way again almost every hand went up. After speaking to my Head who was very supportive we agreed I could tell the class that I am gay so they at least knew one gay person and hopefully explain that when people use that word they are talking about me. The reaction was fantastic – there were a lot of gasps and shocked looks and some basic questions – do you have a boyfriend etc – but after a couple of minutes they were over it and we moved on to the rest of the lesson. The letter came a couple of days later. The little girl who wrote it gave it to me at the start of the day with all the other slips about dinner money school trips and doctors appointments. Reading it brought tears to my eyes and it took me a little while to compose myself. When I thanked her she just shrugged and repeated something one of the boys in the class had said during the lesson it is just your life. Then she went back to her maths. For my class it was a surprise sure but to them it was just something simple and easy to file away as another piece of information. There was no judgement no follow up just acceptance. Now I can mention my fiance as easily as any other teacher and my class know me a little better. I have had a lot of letters and cards over the years but this one I know I will keep forever

1135,Claim Mitt Romney said Michelle Obama should be called the First Woman not the First Lady. FALSE Example Collected via e mail January 2015 Did Mitt Romney make the statement noted below on the Laura Ingraham show on 11214. Was this the exact statement made. Was it taken out of context. or. it is false advertising to call Mrs Obama the First Lady. First Woman maybe but certainly not a lady. Ann Romney is an actual lady. Origins On 13 January 2015 the Facebook group Stop the World The Teabaggers Want to Get Off posted an image of Mitt Romney along with a quote attributed to him about First Lady Michelle Obama The image alleges Romney made the displayed comment about referring to Michelle Obama as the First Woman rather than the First Lady during an appearance on the Laura Ingraham Show on 12 January 2014. A search of that radio programs guest archives however shows the former presidential candidate was not a guest on the show on that date. Romneys purported comments about the First Lady are also suspiciously missing from political blogs and major newspapers. Furthermore the Stop the World Facebook group has garnered a reputation for attributing fictitious quotes to conservative politicians. On 27 November 2014 that group posted a dubious diatribe attributed to Congresswoman Michele Bachmann about the red Indian and Thanksgiving and on 1 January 2015 it claimed Sarah Palin had made offensive comments about white privilege. While the Facebook page does not contain a disclaimer labeling it a satirical site it is clear Stop the World The Teabaggers Want to Get Off should not be considered a trusted source of political information. kmnsize 300x250 kmnplacement 1c8834441f20e22a0aef009c095a6cab googleadclient pub 6608306193529351 googleadwidth 468 googleadheight 60 googleadformat 468x60as googleadtype text googleadchannel 0054321535 googlecolorborder 000000

1653,Igor Vorozhbitsyn was going fishing in Yakutia Republic when the bear began to maul him. But Biebers Baby had been installed as a ringtone on his phone — and caused the bear to stop and flee after he got a call. Justin Bieber saved a Russian fisherman from the clutches of a killer bear. The deadly beast bolted after hearing the pop brats smash hit Baby blasting out of Igor Vorozhbitsyns cellphone. The 42 year old was walking to his favorite angling spot in the Yakutia Republic when the animal pounced. As it clawed his face the rodman feared he was about to be killed. But then his cell phone started to ring and the Bieber tone installed by his granddaughter startled his attacker who fled back into the forest. Vorozhbitsyn who suffered deep cuts and bruises to his face and chest then used his cell to call for help. I could not believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled he told the Croatian Times. I know that sort of ringtone is not to everyones taste but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke he added. On a mobile device. Click here to watch video
661,you have heard of the third nipple — but what about a third breast. A Tampa massage therapist Jasmine Tridevil underwent surgery to get just that. Tridevil told Orlando radio station Real Radio 1041 that she spent close to 20000 on the procedure. Tridevil told the station that she contacted more than 50 doctors before finding one who would give her the third breast. It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they are breaking the code of ethics she said. The surgeon she found could not create a silicone areola though so she had one tattooed onto the implant which is made from silicone and skin tissue from her stomach. While Tridevils dream is to star in an MTV reality show she told the radio station she had the surgery to become unattractive to men in addition to gaining fame. I do not want to date anymore she said. Tridevil also noted that her parents are displeased with the surgery — her mother no longer speaks to her and her father really is not happy but has accepted it she said.

94,Becoming a supplier for an Apple product is big competition among Asia Pacific suppliers but Apple will rely on just one supplier to make all of its Apple Watch displays this year reports JP Morgan analyst JJ Park. LG Display will be the sole supplier of the p OLED display for the Apple Watch according to Parks recent note to investors. His firm also predicts LGs stock could jump as much as 25 because of the new deal. JP Morgan estimates LGs Apple Watch deal could generate 14 trillion in revenue for the company in 2015 assuming the average sale price for a tiny p OLED is 45 the entire year. The team forecasts Apple will ship 29 million watches this year. By 2016 that number could more than double to 61 million based on their projections. Samsung has also been identified as one of the suppliers of the 32bit S1 processor. The System in Package module might be made by ASE while the chip package could come from Amkor and STATS. Tim Cook revealed that Apple Watch is schedule to ship in April though a firm launch date has not been announced. An event is expected to be held in March or early April to give customers full details on features pricing and launch

1723,Apple is taking the security of its new Apple Watches seriously. According to a report from 9to5Mac the Cupertino company is installing custom made safes in its Apple Stores for storing the high end 18k gold Apple Watches. Some of the safes are already in place and come with MagSafe chargers inside them to ensure the watches remain charged at all times. they will likely be used to carry both to be sold inventory as well as to store demo units from the show floor overnight the tech blog reports. Apple is also working on special weight scales for measuring the Apple Watch. This is to stop customers buying the device secretly removing or replacing the gold and then returning it to the store after selling the precious metal on. So how much is the 18K gold Apple watch retailing for. it is not yet confirmed but rumours peg the price point at somewhere between 1200 and 5000. The regular models are a bargain in comparison starting at just 349. According to Apple CEO Tim Cook we should expect to see an Apple Watch launch at some point in April — though tester models are already being spotted in the wild. Heres a promotional photo of the gold model And heres how it looks on the wrist
1552,HP is set to cleave itself in two splitting off its PC and printer division from its enterprise and services business. According to The Wall Street Journal an announcement could come as soon as tomorrow. Sources familiar with the matter tell the paper that current CEO Meg Whitman will become chairman of the PC and printer operation and will remain CEO of the split off enterprise business. Dion Weisler will become CEO of the personal computing business — he is currently a high ranking executive in the division. This is not the first time talk of splitting HP has surfaced. During some of the companys very tumultuous 2011 reports suggested that executives were close to making the very same decision to split off the enterprise division into its own business. After the departure of then CEO Léo Apotheker the company decided to keep the units together under the same corporate umbrella. The company based in Palo Alto has struggled along with the rest of the PC industry as profit margins have slimmed and sales of Windows PC continue to steadily decline. The companys printer business is more lucrative than its PC operation though the two were combined into the same unit back in 2012. That same year HP lost the title of top selling PC manufacturer to Lenovo
1394,Apple rumors do not stop and today there is a fresh one that discusses what we might be able to expect from the iPhone 6s later this year. Todays rumors sound a bit outlandish but not out of the question. According to MoneyUDN the iPhone 6s will pack new camera features including a dual lens camera with a built in optical zoom function. Optical zoom allows you to take clearer shots when zooming in on a subject as opposed to software enabled zoom which often leaves the subject looking blurry or grainy. Storage options may also change. UDN cites supply chain sources who suggest Apple will continue to offer the 47 inch and 55 inch screen sizes but will bump the entry level iPhone 6siPhone 6s Plus storage to 32GB instead of 16GB. there is also reportedly some new display technology at work. Another supply chain legend discussed by UDN suggests that the iPhone 6s will employ two pressure sensors one of which will have a role in health monitoringfunctions offering more accurate ways to track a users heart rate and blood pressure. The site also lists a 3D pressure sensor that may be built into the touch panel for an additional Z axis. To us that suggests possible 3D user interface interactions though UDN instead points to 3D imaging technologies that might take advantage of the pressure sensor. One of those rumors lines up with a patent Apple received in April of last year which discussed presssure sensitive touchscreen technology that allows the display to distinguish between soft taps and stronger more forceful inputs that technology is also making its way into the Apple Watch. Wacky. Maybe a bit and the supply chain is often filled with outlandish rumors but again none of this seems completely out of the question. Whether these rumors come to fruition or not… well we will not know until closer to September 2015

2581,Yet more bad news for Obamacare this week Molina Healthcare lost 110 million on the exchanges last year and the CEO told investors There are simply too many unknowns with the marketplace program to commit to our participation beyond 2017. At first glance it is hard to see why this piece of news is worth worrying about. UnitedHealth recently projected several times those losses and it is a bigger player on the exchanges. Why spend so much time looking at one modest size insurer. Because Molina is one of the companies that has been repeatedly pointed to by virtually every health care policy wonk in the business as one of the bright spots on the exchanges. Molina is a company that specializes in covering poor people. Before Obamacare they were a sizable player in the Medicaid managed care model and it seemed like the expertise they had thusly acquired was allowing them to design the sort of plans that actually made money on the exchanges. Which is to say bare bones plans not fancy but adequate. Apparently that is no longer a money maker at least for Molina. This is not necessarily the pattern we have seen with other insurers. Molina seems to have made money until it was forced to pay into a fund designed to transfer money from insurers that ended up with an unusually healthy patient pool to those who got stuck with the sicker patients. Those losses were partially offset by lower medical costs than they expected which is certainly good news. But it is not great news. Lower than expected costs can be from the system working well or they can simply come from the fact that you happened to get a healthier insurance pool. If the government makes you give the latter gains back and more then you are still not going to be profitable. And insurers that are not profitable over the long term are not going to stick around. Nor can you fix the problem by adjusting the transfer fund. Those losses are occurring somewhere in the market someone has to pay for the care. If you got rid of Obamacares risk transfer provisions those insurers would lose more money and exit the market and the patients would end up with some other insurer. Who would then lose a bunch of money on them. Unless the insurance market is profitable in aggregate the exchanges are not going to stabilize. Molinas losses suggest that instead of stabilizing the exchanges are getting worse. There is no way to fix Obamacare without fixing the pool so that younger healthier people buy insurance. Democrats had six years to come up with a way to do that. They failed. Now Republicans are taking their shot and so far at least they do not seem any more on target than Democrats were. The life expectancy of the individual market for health insurance is not looking good
1414,It looks like Apples 129 inch iPad has been delayed. The heavily rumored large screen iPad sometimes referred to as an iPad Pro was initially reported to be launching in the first quarter of 2015. A new report from KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo says Apple has faced delays on its 129 inch iPad which will push the launch into the second quarter of 2015. it is important to note that Kuo has a stellar track record when it comes to Apple which means this is likely more than just a rumor. The tablet us delay reportedly stems from the type of display that Apple intends to use in the tablet which will utilize newer LCD technologies for faster response times and higher color saturation according to Kuo. Citing a time crunch on component production and assembly Kuo believes the iPad Pro will not enter mass production until the second quarter of 2015 months later than Apples original plans
79,DEVELOPING An Internet video purports to show the beheading of US reporter Steven Sotloff by the Islamic State extremist group. The global terror intelligence firm SITE first reported the release of the video titled A Second Message to America in which Sotloff a 31 year old freelance journalist speaks to the camera before a cloaked Islamic State fighter decapitates him. I am sure you know exactly who I am by now and why I am appearing Sotloff said. Obama your foreign policy of intervention in Iraq was supposed to be for preservation of American lives and interests so why is it that I am paying the price of your interference with my life. The video then cuts to the masked militant warning that as long as US missiles continue to strike our people our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people. He also threatens the life of British captive David Cawthorne Haines. The grim video comes just days after Sotloffs mother Shirley directly addressed the leader of the Islamic State last week saying her son should not pay for US government actions in the Middle East and that he cared about the weak and oppressed as a journalist. I want what every mother wants to live to see her childrens children she said last week. I plead with you to grant me this. Shirley Sotloff cited by name the leader of the Islamic State Abu Bakr al Baghdadi who has described himself as a caliph intending to lead the Muslim world. She had asked him to show mercy and follow the example of the prophet Muhammad in protecting people of Muslim Jewish and Christian faiths. Sotloff was last seen in August 2013 in Syria. He was recently threatened with death by the militants on a video unless the US stopped airstrikes on the group in Iraq. The same video showed the beheading of fellow American journalist James Foley 45. Several US officials including US Rep Ileana Ros Lehtinen R Fla have said they were working behind the scenes to find out more about Sotloff and try to secure his release. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest could not confirm the reports when asked about the video at Tuesdays press briefing. He noted the administration has been monitoring his situation carefully since threats were first made. The United States as you know has dedicated significant time and resources to try and rescue Mr Sotloff he said adding thoughts and prayers are with the family. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the intelligence community will work as quickly as possible to determine the videos authenticity. If the video is genuine we are sickened by this brutal act taking the life of another innocent American citizen she told reporters. Pressed by Fox News Psaki would not say whether this would constitute an act of war. She said the prior execution of journalist James Foley was a horrific terrorist act and was a motivating factor for creating a coalition to address the Islamic State.

2112,A sexually frustrated snowy owl nicknamed the Black Widow has killed her mate because his penis was too small. Staff at the animal shelter in Knyszynska Forest in Poland where she lives had introduced a male snow owl into her enclosure to offer her company. However two days later her mate was found dead and half devoured. Shelter spokesman Robert Konowal said The first two days were fine and they seemed to get on very well. MORE Sisters kicked out of Cambodia over porn shoot at sacred temple We were horrified when we then discovered she had killed him. At first we could not understand why but we took the remains to a vet who after examining him found that his testicle sack and private parts were underdeveloped. In other words he was not a suitable lover and we assume that after failing to perform she killed him probably out of frustration. For any Harry Potter fans out there this may change your opinion of Hedwig who was also a female snowy owl.

As Entertainmentie reports After a number of complaints from passengers about random males being seated next to their wives Saudi Arabias national airline is looking in to segregating their flights. Saudi Arabias national airline Saudia will order its staff to keep men and women seated separately on flights from now on after passengers complained about the lack of segregation on their flights. The Emirates247 news website reported that the airline which already complies with many of the religious practices of Islam including not offering alcohol or dishes that contain pork on their flights have decided to separate men and women on board unless they are close relatives. Abdul Rahman Al Fahd Saudias assistant manager for marketing said that there are solutions to this problem…we will soon enforce rules that will satisfy all passengers. Why not just have separate planes. Will Saudi segregate homo and hetero sexuals. How about heavy and not so heavy people. And then there is race
2543,Conventional medical authorities say that consumption of saturated animal fats is bad for you and causes heart disease. But a hundred years ago fewer than than one in one hundred Americans were obese and coronary heart disease was unknown. The Procter and Gamble started marketing Crisco as a new kind of food the first commercially marketed trans fat. Crisco was originally used to make candles and soap but with electrification causing a decline in candle sales Procter and Gamble decided to promote the fat as a healthier all vegetable derived shortening According to LewRockwellcom Feeding high doses of fat and cholesterol to omnivores like rats and dogs does not produce atherosclerotic lesions in them. In fact it turns out that people who have highest percentage of saturated fat in their diets have the lowest risk of heart disease. The last word on this subject should go to Julia Child. Enjoy eating saturated fats they are good for you. Dr Mercolas Comments The demonization of saturated fat began in 1953 when Dr Ancel Keys published a paper comparing saturated fat intake and heart disease mortality. His theory turned out to be flimsy to say the least but the misguided ousting of saturated fat has continued unabated ever since. Fortunately the truth is finally starting to come out as medical scientists have begun to seriously question Keys findings. Time to Put Ancel Keys Theory to Rest Keys based his theory on a study of six countries in which higher saturated fat intake equated to higher rates of heart disease. However he conveniently ignored data from 16 other countries that did not fit his theory. Had he chosen a different set of countries the data would have shown that increasing the percent of calories from fat reduces the number of deaths from coronary heart disease. And as illustrated in the featured article when you include all 22 countries for which data was available at the time of his study you find that those who consume the highest percentage of saturated fat have the lowest risk of heart disease. Furthermore many have now realized that it is the trans fat found in margarine vegetable shortening and partially hydrogenated vegetable oils that is the true villain causing far more significant health problems than saturated fat ever could. Still despite the scientific evidence the low fat dogma remains a favorite among most government health authorities. Case in point the most recent food chart issued by the US Department of Agriculture in December of last year recommends reducing your saturated fat intake to a mere seven percent of caloric intake—down from its previously recommended 10 percent… Newer Studies Debunk Keys Theory The USDAs lowered recommendation is illogical when you consider the evidence available today which supports saturated fat as a necessary part of a heart healthy diet. For example as discussed in the featured article a number of indigenous tribes around the world are living proof that a high saturated fat diet equates to low mortality from heart disease. These include Tribe Primary Diet Percentage Saturated Fat Maasai tribe in KenyaTanzania Meat milk cattle blood 66 percent Inuit Eskimos in the Arctic Whale meat and blubber 75 percent Rendille tribe in NE Kenya Camel milk meat blood 63 percent Tokealu atoll islands in New Zealand territory Fish and coconuts 60 percent And then there is human breast milk which contains 54 percent saturated fat. Since breast milk is the most perfect diet in existence for developing infants the presence of high amounts of saturated fat can not easily be construed as a mistake. Furthermore A meta analysis published last year which pooled data from 21 studies and included nearly 348000 adults found no difference in the risks of heart disease and stroke between people with the lowest and highest intakes of saturated fat. In a 1992 editorial published in the Archives of Internal Medicine Dr William Castelli a former director of the Framingham Heart study stated In Framingham Mass the more saturated fat one ate the more cholesterol one ate the more calories one ate the lower the persons serum cholesterol. The opposite of what… Keys et al would predict…We found that the people who ate the most cholesterol ate the most saturated fat ate the most calories weighed the least and were the most physically active. Another 2010 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that a reduction in saturated fat intake must be evaluated in the context of replacement by other macronutrients such as carbohydrates. When you replace saturated fat with a higher carbohydrate intake particularly refined carbohydrate you exacerbate insulin resistance and obesity increase triglycerides and small LDL particles and reduce beneficial HDL cholesterol. The authors state that dietary efforts to improve your cardiovascular disease risk should primarily emphasize the limitation of refined carbohydrate intake and weight reduction. I believe that last point is very important and is likely a major key for explaining the rampant increase in obesity heart disease and diabetes. And once you can pinpoint the problem turning it all around becomes that much easier. Carbohydrates Not Fat is the Root of Obesity and Heart Disease Heart disease is so common today it is hard for people to remember that a mere 100 years ago this disease was really uncommon. As Dr Donald Miller writes in the featured article There were 500 cardiologists practicing in the US in 1950. There are 30000 of them now – a 60 fold increase for a population that has only doubled since 1950. Such an explosion of heart disease indicates that something has changed that is contributing to this epidemic. What is that something. Our diet. Most likely the studies that have linked the so called Western diet to an increased heart disease risk simply confirm that sugar and refined carbohydrates are harmful to your heart health. Because although the Western diet is high in red and processed meats and saturated fats it is also alarmingly high in sugar and refined carbs like bread and pasta. And as concluded in the last study listed above when you reduce saturated fat and increase refined carbohydrates you end up promoting obesity heart disease and diabetes Gary Taubes has also done an excellent job of explaining the connection between carbs and obesity and its related health issues in his book Why We Get Fat and what to do about it. In a nutshell eating fat and protein does not make you fat—carbohydrates doI firmly believe the two primary keys for successful weight management and reducing your risk for diabetes heart disease and other weight related health problems are Severely restricting carbohydrates in your diet and Increasing healthy fat consumption According to last years Report of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans the top 10 sources of calories in the American diet are Grain based desserts 139 calories a day Alcoholic beverages Yeast breads 129 calories a day Pasta and pasta dishes Chicken and chicken mixed dishes 121 calories a day Mexican mixed dishes Soda energy drinks and sports drinks 114 calories a day Beef and beef mixed dishes Pizza 98 calories a day Dairy desserts Looking at this list it plain to see that CARBS—ie. sugars and grains—are the primary sources of our weight and health problems not saturated fats. As an update you have often heard me state that soda is the number one source of calories in the US diet which it was—based on the 1999 2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The updated NHANES survey above covers nutritional data from 2005 2006 placing grain based foods in the top two slots. Still soda comes in at number four and I still believe a lot of people particularly teenagers probably get a majority of their calories from fructose rich drinks like soda. The Different Types of Fat Fats can be confusing but you can generally divide fats into four types Saturated fats from animal fat and tropical oils Monounsaturated fat such as olive oil Polyunsaturated fat such as omega 3 and omega 6 fats Trans fats such as margarine Sources of healthy fats include Olives and Olive oil Coconuts and coconut oil Butter made from raw grass fed organic milk Raw Nuts such as almonds or pecans Organic pastured egg yolks Avocados Grass fed meats Palm oil Unheated organic nut oils Another healthful fat you want to be mindful of is animal based omega 3. Deficiency in this essential fat can cause or contribute to very serious health problems both mental and physical and may be a significant underlying factor of up to 96000 premature deaths each year. For more information about omega 3s and the best sources of this fat please review this previous article. Having the proper balance between omega 3 and omega 6 fats is also very important for optimal health. So in addition to increasing your omega 3 you also want to decrease your consumption of omega 6 found primarily in Corn oil Soy oil Canola oil Safflower oil Sunflower oil The ideal ratio of omega 3 to omega 6 is 11 but the typical American diet is more like 120 in favor of omega 6. The overabundance of these oils in processed foods of all kinds explains our excess omega 6 levels. The other fats you want to avoid are the trans fats. Trans fats are formed when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil during food processing in order to make it solidify. This process known as hydrogenation makes fats less likely to spoil so foods stay fresh longer have a longer shelf life and also have a less greasy feel. The end result of the hydrogenation process is a completely unnatural fat that causes dysfunction and chaos in your body on a cellular level. Your Body NEEDS Saturated Fat for Optimal Function Saturated fats from animal and vegetable sources provide a number of important health benefits. In fact your body can not function without saturated fats. Saturated fats are needed for the proper function of your Cell membranes Heart Bones Liver Lungs Hormones Immune system Satiety Genetic regulation Healthy Fat Tips to Live By So please remember you do need a certain amount of healthy fat while at the same time you will want to avoid the unhealthy varieties. The easiest way to accomplish this is to simply eliminate processed foods which are high in all things detrimental to your health sugar carbs and dangerous types of fats. After that these tips can help ensure you are eating the right fats for your health Use organic butter made from raw grass fed milk instead of margarines and vegetable oil spreads. Butter is a healthy whole food that has received an unwarranted bad rap. Use coconut oil for cooking. It is far superior to any other cooking oil and is loaded with health benefits. Following my nutrition plan will automatically reduce your modified fat intake as it will teach you to focus on healthy whole foods instead of processed junk food. To round out your healthy fat intake be sure to eat raw fats such as those from avocados raw dairy products and olive oil and also take a high quality source of animal based omega 3 fat such as krill oil
2006,The most luxury versions of the smart watch are made of 18 carat gold expected to cost thousands of pounds and will have their own sales process like a jewelery store Apple Stores are to be fitted with new extra secure safes to look after the luxury edition of the Apple Watch which is expected to cost thousands of pounds. The safes will look after the watches before they are sold as well as housing the demo watches overnight according to a report by Apple blog 9to5mac. They will also be fitted with chargers to keep the watches ready for demonstrations the next day. The Apple Watch Edition is the most high end of the three versions of the Apple Watch which also include the standard Apple Watch and the lower priced Apple Watch Sport. The cheapest Sport is set to cost around £250 but the Edition — which features 18 carat gold — is expected to sell for thousands of pounds. Because of the high price the Edition is likely to have its own sales process according to the report. That is likely to be more similar to that in jewellery stores. The Apple Watch will be released in April according to Tim Cook. Ahead of the launch the company is also exploring how it can demonstrate the Apple Watch to customers. It is expected that people will be able to try on the watches in Apples shops — the ability to use other devices in Apple Stores is often credited with their success
700,This video has been hugely viral for months but it is only recently that English speakers have begun to share it. Some sites are claiming it is from a Peruvian TV show but it is not. it is actually a mockumentary by the sports brand Everlast and this campaign to stop street harassment. As such it is staged but anyway – the video purports to show how some men who whistle and make sexist comments on the streets were tricked by a film team. The team played out dressing the abusers mothers differently and disguising them… …waiting for the men to start catcalling… …and then giving them hell. Now it did not actually happen. That said El País actually claimed that the campaign is based on interviews with men who accidentally harassed female relatives by mistake. And the message seems to be getting through. The original has had over 5 million views. The campaign also features Natalia Málaga a celebrated volleyball player and coach. Back in 2013 she and Everlast put this advert together in which women drivers who were being harassed by men could tweet their location and she had punch their cars with her own giant boxing glove car. As this blog points out it was all rather questionable on grounds of authenticity and indeed practicality but it was a massive hit
369,The Islamic State group has made gains in Iraq approaching the countrys largest city Monday as American led airstrikes have hit the groups strongholds in Syria. The news of the bloodthirsty groups march towards Baghdad comes after President Obama admitted the US underestimated the group — and overestimated the Iraqi Army. The flood of Islamic State militants has reached Baghdads doors reportedly just one mile from the Iraqi capital despite intense fighting and airstrikes to the west. The growing and expanding terrorist group has gained ground over a large swath of Syria and Iraq but ISIS entering the city of some 7 million people could prove disastrous to America and its allies hoping to stem the flow of the extremists. That scenario is close to reality according to the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East a nonprofit supporting the work of Canon Andrew White a priest leading the citys only Anglican church. The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad the group wrote Monday morning on Facebook. They said it could never happen and now it almost has. Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to be hear a very short while to know they can do very very little. ISIS has already taken control of Mosul Iraqs second largest city while fierce fighting is underway in Fallujah a key town some 25 miles from Baghdad. And Iraqi troops were battling ISIS some six miles west of Baghad the BBC reported. But despite airstrike support the army could barely contain the militants much less force a retreat. The news comes hours after President Obama admitted on 60 Minutes that his administration including intelligence services underestimated the power and scope of the Islamic State which has chewed up territory over the last three years across large parts of war torn Syria and Iraq in a ruthless display of power. During the chaos of the Syrian civil war where essentially you had huge swaths of the country that are completely ungoverned they were able to reconstitute themselves and take advantage of that chaos Obama said on. ISIS is sort of a hybrid of not just the terrorist network but one with territorial ambitions and some of the strategy and tactics of an army Obama said. Now military advisers have told the President ISIS boasts as many as 40000 fighters who swear allegiance to Abu Bakr al Baghdadis goal of creating a new Islamic caliphate. US led airstrikes overnight hit targets in the northern and eastern Syrian provinces of Aleppo Raqqa Hassakeh and Deir el Zour in an attempt to wipe out the groups oil weapons and military facilities. Other strikes hit Iraqs Anbar province. But most dire may be the bloodthirsty groups march on Baghdad. President Obama is saying that he overestimated the ability of the Iraqi Army Rev. White wrote on Facebook. It is so clear they have no ability. A hard thing to say but its true. With News Wire Services sgoldstein nydailynewscom ON A MOBILE DEVICE. CLICK HERE FOR VIDEO
1279,NEW YORK—Oil prices jumped Wednesday on unconfirmed rumors in the market that a pipeline exploded in Saudi Arabia raising fears that the countrys crude production and exports could be curtailed. A spokesperson for Saudi Aramco Saudi Arabias oil company told The Wall Street Journal that the company has seen the rumors which circulated on Twitter but is not able to confirm them. Prices have been sliding for months on concerns that the market is oversupplied and that Saudi Arabia the biggest oil exporter is unlikely to cut production to raise prices.

2552,President Trump has told multiple people including EPA head Scott Pruitt that he intends to pull the US out of the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change according to a new Axios report based on information from three anonymous sources with direct knowledge of the conversations. Earlier Saturday Trump announced on Twitter that he would make a decision on the accord next week. Over the past three days European leaders and even Pope Francis have lobbied Trump to support the agreement but while leaders from the six other nations in the G7 signed a statement reaffirming their commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions on Saturday Trump abstained. The entire discussion about climate was very difficult if not to say very unsatisfying announced German chancellor Angela Merkel clearly frustrated with Trumps indecision during the talks. Axios adds that it is possible Trump will impulsively change his mind as Trump has done after telling people he would do something in the past Axios also points out that all of Trumps options for withdrawing from the deal would require as much as a year to carry through on allowing for some additional uncertainty. Speaking of uncertainty in a Face the Nation interview set to air on CBS Sunday Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said that he was quite certain the president is wide open on this issue as he takes in the pros and cons of that accord. Speaking with the New York Times Trumps chief economic adviser Gary Cohn also made it sound as if Trump was still making up his mind after a lot of give and take between the different countries at the G7 summit. But according to Axioss sources Trump has already made his decision to ditch the pact and that would definitely be consistent with his numerous past statements as one of the worlds most notorious deniers of the consensus scientific conclusion that human activity is the primary driver of global climate change. He also said during his presidential campaign that he would cancel the deal and has infamously and repeatedly called global warming a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese — but Trump says a lot of things and has at least a few times also hinted that he understood the threat of climate change. President Obama helped negotiate the historic Paris Agreement in 2015 and it was officially ratified by the US and 194 other signatories last year. Should Trump leave the pact the US would be the first country to exit which would also be the second time that America has signed onto a global climate deal under a Democratic president only to walk away from the same agreement under a Republican predecessor as President George W Bush ultimately reneged on the Kyoto Protocol agreed to by President Bill Clinton in 1997. Americas exit from the Paris Agreement would not invalidate the accord which still has the support of most of the world including China and is likely to proceed without US participation. But the failure of the US to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions being the worlds second highest producer of such pollution will worsen and likely accelerate an already dangerous problem. If other countries follow the US out of the agreement which remains a risk that danger only multiplies
705,A 25 year old South African man has lost the use of his penis following an acid attack by his angry 17 year old girlfriend. She got mad after a video of them having sex went viral. The girl apparently can not be named as she is under age. According to African Eye News Service on January 17 after discovering a pornographic video of her and her boyfriend having sex had gone viral online she went to a tavern in Cork village close to Hazyview in Mpumalanga South Africa where her boyfriend was drinking with friends. South Africa – Girl poured acid on boyfriend Humphrey Khozas penis after he released sex tape Metro News http tcoFhP8qLIBw4. — Mark Nixon February 3 2015 Metro reports on arrival at the tavern the South African schoolgirl immediately doused Humphrey Khozas genitals with battery acid. Khoza himself said everything happened in the blink of an eye Everything happened in a blink of an eye because I saw her when she was coming with a bottle but I did not realize that she was carrying acid. She just angrily called me a dog. She asked how in the world I could have done such an evil thing to her. It was only then that I realized that she was talking about the video that I took while we were having sex. According to Khoza the pair had been dating since December and while they agreed to have sex the girl was unaware that he was filming it using his laptop computer but he never meant to show it to anyone else. I did not intend to show anyone the video and I still do not know how it got onto social media. According to Times Live AENS has seen the offending video to verify the claim. In it Khoza can be seen pushing the girl wearing her school uniform on to the bed. They report that she did not appear to notice they were being filmed while having sex but that it was consensual. Khoza did say that he was lucky to be alive despite the fact that his penis will never work again. He apparently now has to urinate through a tube and is facing further surgery. Even though he has been advised to press charges against the girl the South African man does not see any point. Even if I press charges it is useless because it will not bring back my manhood. Her being in jail will just ruin her future because she is still young and I do not have the energy to attend courts.

19,GR editors Note There are no reports in the Western mainstream media pertaining to this issue. This report is based on statements emanating from the Iraq parliament with photographic evidence. We have not been in a position to corroborate this report by FARS News. Iraqs army has shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the ISIL terrorists in Al Anbar province a senior lawmaker disclosed on Monday. The Iraqi Parliaments National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL Head of the committee Hakem al Zameli said according to a Monday report of the Arabic language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. He said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard. The senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al Anbar province on numerous flights by the US led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist held areas. The Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the terrorist group and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end. Earlier today a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri terrorists in Iraq revealing that US and Israeli made weapons have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists. We have discovered weapons made in the US European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISILs control in Al Baqdadi region the Al Ahad news website quoted Head of Al Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying. He noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city of Ramadi. Al Zameli had also disclosed in January that the anti ISIL coalitions planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in Salahuddin Al Anbar and Diyala provinces. Al Zameli underlined that the coalition is the main cause of ISILs survival in Iraq. There are proofs and evidence for the US led coalitions military aid to ISIL terrorists through air he told FNA in January. He noted that the members of his committee have already proved that the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry including anti aircraft weapons for the ISIL and that it has set up an investigation committee to probe into the matter. The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations. He noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence provided by eyewitnesses including Iraqi army officers and the popular forces and said These documents are given to the investigation committee … and the necessary measures will be taken to protect the Iraqi airspace. Also in January another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that the US led coalition is the main cause of ISILs survival in Iraq. The international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the ISIL and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons Jome Divan who is member of the al Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament said. He said the coalitions support for the ISIL is now evident to everyone and continued The coalition has not targeted ISILs main positions in Iraq. In late December Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province. MP Majid al Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out that US planes are supplying ISIL organization not only in Salahuddin province but also other provinces Iraq TradeLink reported. He added that the US and the international coalition are not serious in fighting against the ISIL organization because they have the technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and destroy them in one month. Gharawi added that the US is trying to expand the time of the war against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces. Salahuddin security commission also disclosed that unknown planes threw arms and ammunition to the ISIL gunmen Southeast of Tikrit city. Also in Late December a senior Iraqi lawmaker raised doubts about the seriousness of the anti ISIL coalition led by the US and said that the terrorist group still received aids dropped by unidentified aircraft. The international coalition is not serious about air strikes on ISIL terrorists and is even seeking to take out the popular forces from the battlefield against the Takfiris so that the problem with ISIL remains unsolved in the near future Nahlah al Hababi told FNA. The ISIL terrorists are still receiving aids from unidentified fighter jets in Iraq and Syria she added. Hababi said that the coalitions precise airstrikes are launched only in those areas where the Kurdish Pishmarga forces are present while military strikes in other regions are not so much precise. In late December the US led coalition dropped aids to the Takfiri militants in an area North of Baghdad. Field sources in Iraq told al Manar that the international coalition airplanes dropped aids to the terrorist militants in Balad an area which lies in Salahuddin province North of Baghdad. In October a high ranking Iranian commander also slammed the US for providing aid supplies to ISIL adding that the US claims that the weapons were mistakenly airdropped to ISIL were untrue. The US and the so called anti ISIL coalition claim that they have launched a campaign against this terrorist and criminal group – while supplying them with weapons food and medicine in Jalawla region. This explicitly displays the falsity of the coalitions and the US claims Deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri said. The US claimed that it had airdropped weapons and medical aid to Kurdish fighters confronting the ISIL in Kobani near the Turkish border in Northern Syria. The US Defense Department said that it had airdropped 28 bundles of weapons and supplies but one of them did not make it into the hands of the Kurdish fighters. Video footage later showed that some of the weapons that the US airdropped were taken by ISIL militants. The Iranian commander insisted that the US had the necessary intelligence about ISILs deployment in the region and that their claims to have mistakenly airdropped weapons to them are as unlikely as they are untrue
1736,IBM may be set to announce big layoffs this week. IBM shares were higher in early trading on unconfirmed reports that it is getting set to slash 26 of its workforce or nearly 112000 jobs as part of reorganization plan dubbed Project Chrome. The massive jobs cuts would be the biggest in IBMs history and comes after the company reported its 11th straight quarter of declining revenue. However CNBC Jon Fortt is reporting that the number of layoffs could be much smaller in the range of 10000 or less. Yahoo Finance reached out to IBM and they sent us this statement IBM does not comment on rumors even ridiculous or baseless ones. If anyone had checked information readily available from our public earnings statements or had simply asked us they would know that IBM has already announced the company has just taken a 600 million charge for workforce rebalancing. Last year IBM hired 45000 people and the company currently has about 15000 job openings around the world for new skills in growth areas such as cloud analytics security and social and mobile technologies. This is evidence that IBM continues to remix its skills to match where we see the best opportunities in the marketplace. Microsoft getting set to kick off a big week for tech earnings.

865,The cardiac arrest leading to Joan Rivers death happened as the comedians personal doctor began performing a biopsy on her vocal cords a source close to the death investigation told CNN. A staff member at Manhattans Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators that the doctor who has not been publicly identified took a selfie photo in the procedure room while Rivers was under anesthesia the source said. Rivers 81 was at the clinic for a scheduled endoscopy by another doctor gastroenterologist Dr Lawrence Cohen. That procedure intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat involved the insertion of a camera down her throat. After Cohen the clinics medical director finished his work a biopsy was done on Rivers without her prior consent according to the source. An ear nose and throat specialist not certified by the clinic as required by law performed a biopsy on her vocal cords. The doctor is described by the source as Rivers personal ear nose throat physician. Clinic Vocal cord biopsy did not kill Joan Rivers Even though you are a licensed physician you still should have if you will the checks and balances to get your approval to practice in that particular place said Dr Arthur Caplan a medical ethicist at New York Universitys Langone Medical Center. Investigators believe that Rivers vocal chords began to swell during the allegedly unauthorized biopsy cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs which led to cardiac arrest on the morning of August 29 the source said. Rivers 81 was rushed by paramedics from Yorkville Endoscopy to New Yorks Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away where she died a week later. Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement last Thursday denying reports that any vocal cord biopsy has ever been done at the clinic although federal privacy law prevented any patient information from being released. The day after the denial was issued the clinic confirmed that Dr Cohen is not currently performing procedures nor is he currently serving as medical director. The source said that at this time neither Cohen nor the ear nose and throat doctor have been accused of wrongdoing by investigators. The clinic declined to respond to the sources comments about a biopsy or a selfie citing federal privacy law
2158,The 45 year old was investigating the devastating terrorist attack at Charlie Hebdo magazine when he killed himself VIEW GALLERY A senior French police officer investigating the Charlie Hebdo magazine massacre killed himself just hours after the horrific terror attack. Commissioner Helric Fredou 45 shot himself in his police office in Limoges last Wednesday night France 3 reported. His body was found by a colleague at 1am on Thursday hours after the terror attack at the satirical magazines office which left 12 people dead. It has been reported that shortly before committing suicide Commissioner Fredou had met with the family of one of the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack massacre. Speaking to Mirror Online the Union of Commissioners of the National Police confirmed Mr Fredou had committed suicide. In a statement released after his death a spokesman for the union said It is with great sadness that we were informed this morning of the death of our colleague Helric Fredou assigned as Deputy Director of the Regional Service Judicial Police in Limoges. Getty Firefighters carry a victim on a stretcher at the scene of the Charlie Hebdo shooting On this particular day of national mourning police commissioners are hit hard by the tragic death of one of their own. The Union of Commissioners of the National Police would like to present its most sincere condolences to the relatives of Helric. In these difficult times we have a special thought for all his colleagues. Mr Fredou who was single and had no children began his career as a police officer in 1997 working in Versailles. He eventually returned to his home town of Limoges and in 2012 became deputy director of the regional police service. French media reports suggest he was depressed and was suffering from burnout.

1823,Much has been said already about how the release of the Apple Watch will be the biggest change in Apple products since the company began selling touchscreen devices. However Apples new smartwatch will also bring about a small albeit interesting change to their retail locations the installation of safes. Not just small personal safes like you may have in your closet but large professional ones like you often see in traditional jewelry stores. Sources say these forthcoming lockboxes are intended for one thing to store the high end Apple Watch Edition timepieces that come in luxurious gold. Speaking to 9 to 5 Mac these sources say that some Apple Stores are already seeing safe installations take place ahead of the expected April release of the Apple Watch. The safes are expected to be used to securely house the stock of the upscale Apple Watch models along with the demo units from the floor overnight when the store is closed much like the practice at jewelry retailers. Of course any old normal safes would be fit for Apple and their premium goods. The safes Apple Stores will be getting are said to be custom designed and feature installed MagSafe chargers for the Apple Watch which will keep the demo units ready for display the following day. we are still awaiting an announcement from Apple about the pricing of the Apple Watch. The company previously revealed that the base model wearable in aluminum will have a starting price of 349 but the higher end stainless steel and Edition models are still anyones guess. Because the Edition model is set to feature yellow or rose gold it is expected to be priced at well into the thousands. If Apple did not feel it needed safes before to hold its top of the line computers which already cost several thousands in most cases then it is probably a good bet that the Apple Watch Edition is going to be their most expensive product
1553,Rest in purrs. A Florida feline has been dubbed a zombie cat after clawing his way out of an untimely grave. The cats owner Tampa resident Ellis Hutson 52 told ABC News he found his pet Bart in the road a couple of weeks ago. Bart who seemed to have been hit by a car was in a pool of blood and Hutson says he was sure the cat was dead. Because he and the animal were so close he says he could not bear to bury the cat himself. He enlisted the help of his neighbor and watched him put Bart to rest … or so he thought. Days later a bedraggled Bart who had apparently dug himself out of the ground made his way to another neighbors yard Fox 13 reports. I open the door and my neighbors standing there with the cat in her hand Hutson told ABC. She said Bart is not dead. I said that is impossible. We buried Bart. Hutson rushed the cat to the hospital where Bart was treated for injuries including severe head trauma a broken jaw and a dead eye. Veterinarians at the Humane Society of Tampa Bay expect Bart to fully recover and be able to return home although he will lose one of his eyes. media only screen and ethanmobile display none Like Us On Facebook Follow Us On Twitter Contact The Author
2319,James Foley was courageous and his murder by an apparently English accented zealot of the Syria based Islamic State was so horrific that no simple narrative can do it justice. Unless that is you are a conservative political opportunist of a special sort eager to pin the crime on liberal policies. The right wing drunk on a fermenting rotgut of hyperpatriotism and anti left paranoia just knows that Foleys murderers were enabled by bleeding hearts and due process. They think they have found proof that Foleys executioner was a prisoner freed from the US detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. Maybe it was even Barack Hussein Obama himself who gave the order to free this killer. Unnamed aggregators at Twitchy the dittoheads who stare at tweets were the first to round up grumblings—or perhaps hopes—among right wingers early Wednesday that Foleys murderer was freed from the detainee pool. These tinfoil hatters took their inspiration from two anonymously sourced paragraphs buried in an early Washington Post report on Foleys murder from Tuesday Translation Flummoxed UK intel officials were checking the murder against the usual suspects hoping to stumble onto a clue in the tiny pool of data they already had before reluctantly wading into the murkier waters of global jihadism. that is standard sleuthing. And it is sadly unsurprising that the Islamic States propagandists dressed Foley up in an oversized t shirt mimicking the infamous orange jumpsuits put on problem detainees at Gitmo Al Qaeda in Iraq had similarly garbed several of its condemned captives in outfits imitating the jumpsuits—enduring symbols of the mistreatments real and supposed of Gitmo inmates. But to Islamophobic Gitmo loving conservatives these paragraphs could mean so much more Presumably Tsotsoros meant the Bush administration since it is the one that released all of the 10 British citizens that have been repatriated from Guantanamo all between 2004 and 2007. And Yorks choice of ellipses is deceptive since it implies that the Post was referring to some of those ex detainees as Syria based jihadists when it also was referencing a larger pool of some 800 to 1500 other British citizens that have traveled to fight for ISIS. But never let facts get in the way of a good psychotic BS. meme. By Wednesday morning Hot Airs Ed Morrisey was just asking questions and the game of right wing telephone was on By Wednesday night the Gitmo link had become likely on conservative Twitter The rumors like hot sludge on a city street had trickled down to the lowest internet gutter And the rumors mutated into straight up demonstrably false partisan bullshit And hey where did the Islamofascists get that orange jumpsuit anyway. is not that federal government property. You can not just buy that stuff right. Let me reiterate Whatever hype you may hear no UK Guantanamo detainee released by this administration is responsible for this reprehensible murder because this administration has not released any UK detainees from Guantanamo. Is it remotely possible that one of the 10 Gitmo detainees with British citizenship released by the Bush administration has slipped off into Syria and become an executioner. I do not know the whereabouts of all of them so I can not say no for sure. But it is astronomically less likely than the possibility that Jihadi John as the Brits are calling Foleys presumed killer is any one of several hundred other disaffected Syria based zealots with UK passports—like say this doctors brother or any of these idiots all of them younger than the Gitmo releasees. About the only thing that is certain is that conservatives—who cleave to simplistic manichaean narratives like ornery toddlers to security blankets—must have a villain even if they have to create it.

1977,Britain said on Saturday it was investigating reports that a man believed to be a British national suspected of carrying out beheadings in videos released by Islamic State had been wounded in a US led air strike last week. The man dubbed Jihadi John by the British media was believed to have been injured in an air attack on a summit of IS leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last Saturday Britains Mail on Sunday newspaper reported. The groups leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was also said to have been wounded in the attack the paper added. We are aware of reports a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said. We can not confirm these reports. A speech purporting to be by Baghdadi was released on Thursday following contradictory accounts out of Iraq that he had been wounded last Friday in US air strikes. US officials said on Tuesday they could not confirm whether Baghdadi was hit in a strike near Falluja in Iraq. According to the Mail on Sunday which said its source was an unnamed nurse Jihadi John Baghdadi and other wounded IS figures were taken to hospital and then driven to the Syrian city of Raqqa. The paper said it was not clear how serious their injuries were. In videos released by Islamic State the masked black clad militant brandishing a knife and speaking with an English accent appears to have carried out the beheadings of two Americans and two Britons.

1113,ISIS fighters during a military parade in Raqqa Syria. AP PhotoRaqqa Media Center File ANTAKYA Turkey — Middlemen with ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria have turned to a grim new method of trying to secure funds in recent days. With the group having failed to strike deals to ransom the US hostages in its custody — instead beheading three of them since July — its intermediaries are now trying to negotiate the sale of the body of at least one of the men it killed. Three sources in contact with ISIS or its associates told BuzzFeed News that it wants to sell the remains of James Foley the US journalist whose August death was the first in a series of high profile executions of Western hostages by ISIS hands. They said ISIS wants 1 million for Foleys body which it would deliver across the border to Turkey and that the group was willing to provide a DNA sample to facilitate a deal. If true the attempted sale would highlight the ruthlessness behind the hostage taking enterprise that has provided ISIS with deep reservoirs of funds and publicity — as well as the groups cold calculation as it works to raise more cash. At one point early this year ISIS held 23 Western hostages in Syria. Fifteen Europeans were freed as governments reportedly paid millions of dollars in ransoms but the British and American hostages remained. Both governments refuse to negotiate for hostages or to allow families to pay ransoms. In the months since Foleys death ISIS has released videotaped executions of the US journalist Steven Sotloff the British aid worker Alan Henning and the US aid worker Peter Kassig. British journalist John Cantlie and a US woman a 26 year old aid worker remain in ISIS hands. All three of the sources seeking to act as middlemen in a deal with the secretive extremists have been granted anonymity to protect their safety. One a former Syrian rebel fighter has ties to ISIS commanders dating to the early stages of Syrias civil war. He said he has served as an intermediary in hostage negotiations with Jabhat al Nusra the Syrian branch of al Qaeda and with ISIS. One day this fall to prove his bona fides in the murky trade he opened his iPhone to display unpublished videos of Western hostages in Nusras custody. This former rebel said he was approached by an ISIS leader who asked him to find a channel to either the US government or Foleys family. Like the other sources he noted a price of 1 million and the promise of DNA. They ask for 1 million and they will send DNA to Turkey but they want the money first he said. They will not give the DNA without the money. He claimed his motivation was to help the grieving family find closure calling his work a humanity case. Another intermediary a businessman who has sought to use his own ISIS connections to facilitate hostage deals in the past was candid about his goals This is business. The trade in Western hostages has created a shadowy marketplace in which middlemen like these seek to negotiate deals in order to receive commission. They might inflate their connections on one side of proposed negotiations in order to draw interest from the other so they can make a case for being included in the transaction. The idea of selling Foleys body has drawn attention among some of these middlemen of late according to a Syrian who was involved with previous negotiations with ISIS over US hostages. Both the former rebel fighter and the businessman said that one point person for the negotiations would be a senior official in the Free Syrian Army the US backed rebel coalition who was involved in previous ISIS talks over US hostages as well as deals to free European ones. In an interview in Antakya this FSA official expressed dismay that word of the attempted sale of Foleys remains had leaked. He urged this reporter not to publish an article on the subject fearing that the attention could sabotage any potential deal. Of particular concern he said was that the US government might seek to put a stop to it. Having allowed the US hostages to die in ISIS custody he reasoned it would look bad if such a deal succeeded now. Foleys parents have said that the US government threatened them with prosecution if they paid a ransom for their sons release. It will be like a shame for the US government the FSA official said. People will ask why you brought the body but you did not bring him when he was alive. The FSA official described himself as the manager of the proposed negotiations. He was in touch with a middleman representing ISIS he said and if a deal progressed would seek to arrange it with someone representing the Foley family. As before ISIS seemed intent on making money from its hostage enterprise by any means. They were trying to negotiate for his freedom before they beheaded him and after beheading him they are trying to sell his body the FSA official said. The Foley family had no comment for this article. An official with the US State Department said we are seeking more information on whether ISIS is trying to sell the remains of US hostages. A senior US diplomat called the idea disgusting. With additional reporting by Munzer al Awad in Turkey

259,Now that is an awkward dinner conversation A filmmaker in Peru seems to have come up with an ingenious solution to men sexually harassing women in the street — trick serial offenders into catcalling their own mothers. Two moms are shown agreeing to be secretly filmed as they donned flattering disguises and strolled past their unwitting sons. After the men shout out sleazy comments the women pull off their wigs and confront their red faced boys with a very loud and very public rebuke. One enraged mother is seen hitting her son over the head with her handbag. The clip created by American clothing brand Everlast was filmed in Perus national capital Lima where the company says 7 out of 10 women report being harassed in the street
2430,Iraqi forces reach centre of northern city of Baiji in attempt to break the Isis siege of the countrys biggest refinery Authorities in Iraq were tonight investigating claims that the Isis leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi had been critically injured in US led air strikes prompting speculation of his death. The death of the elusive leader would mark a significant change in the US led effort to curtail the Islamist extremist group. Britains chief of the defence staff General Sir Nicholas Houghton warned however that the Isis leadership would regenerate even if Baghdadi had been killed. General Houghton told the BBC I can not absolutely confirm that Baghdadi has died. Even the Americans themselves are not yet in a position to do that. Probably it will take some days to have absolute confirmation. Fridays strikes destroyed an Isis convoy near the Iraqi city of Mosul but US officials said it was unclear whether the groups top commander had been in any of the 10 targeted vehicles. Tribal sources told the Saudi news channel Al Arabiya that after the strike Isis members scrambled to transport the wounded to al Qaim hospital which was overwhelmed with the injured. Meanwhile Iraqi military forces reached the centre of the northern city of Baiji on Sunday trying to break the Isis siege of the countrys biggest refinery outside the city. This led to fierce fighting. Sunni insurgents had seized Baiji in June during a lightning advance through northern Iraq. Since then they surrounded the refinery and halted its production while a detachment of government troops inside has held out for months under siege. An Iraqi colonel said troops had entered Baiji a city of about 200000 people from the south and west and took over the al Tamim neighbourhood and city centre. Isis had placed bombs along the roads and deployed snipers to keep the government forces from advancing – tactics used in other cities held by the ultra hardline Sunni group which controls swathes of both Iraq and Syria

1284,The Apple Watch will reportedly be available in other countries including Germany when it launches in April according to 9to5Macs Mark Gurman. Apple CEO Tim Cook shared this information with employees at the companys flagship store in Berlin according to Gurman who says he spoke with an Apple employee in attendance. Specifically Cook said the watch will not be exclusive to the United States in April. it is unclear which markets the Apple Watch will be available in and whether or not it will be released at exactly the same time in multiple markets. As Gurman points out it is possible Apple could release the Apple Watch in the US before releasing it to international markets such as Germany later in the month. This is a somewhat unusual move for Apple to make with a first generation product. Both the iPhone and iPad were available exclusively in the US before expanding to other markets. Apple has been showing off its watch at boutiques in Paris and in the Paris edition of Vogue so it seems like the company is making a push to market the watch overseas as well as Gurman also noted. We expect to learn more next week when Apple holds its press event on March 9. SEE ALSO We asked a bunch of fitness experts about the Apple Watch — heres what they had to say
463,The White House is vehemently pushing back against a report that it threatened to prosecute the families of two slain American journalists if they ponied up ransom money to ISIS. We did not threaten anybody but we made clear what the law is White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said on Fox News Sunday. that is our responsibility to make sure we explain the law and uphold the law. The White House took every effort to rescue both men McDonough added. The families of James Foley and Steven Sotloff the two journalists beheaded by ISIS claim the Obama administration threatened to prosecute them if they tried to free the men on their own. ISIS had demanded ransom money in exchange for their kidnapped victims though such payments are illegal as they are considered to be material support for terrorism. Jon Terbush
69,The group calling itself the Islamic State has released a video purporting to show the execution of American journalist Steven Sotloff according to the Site Intelligence Group. Sotloff is the second American journalist brutally murdered by ISIS in less than two weeks. On Aug 20 the group released a video showing the execution of James Foley during which they also promised to execute Sotloff if the US did not cease airstrikes against the group in Iraq. The video of Sotloff which was posted by Site was entitled A Second Message To America. Based on a portion of the footage that was posted by Site and seen by Business Insider it begins with footage of President Barack Obama speaking about the airstrikes the US launched against Islamic State last month. It goes on to show Sotloff being held at knifepoint in an orange jumpsuit and behing forced to deliver a statement a similar procedure for Foley in the video of his execution. White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday afternoon he was not immediately in a position to determine the authenticity of the video. He said the White Houses thoughts and prayers were with Sotloffs family. If the video is genuine we are sickened State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. She said the intelligence community would work quickly to determine the videos authenticity. In the video released Tuesday by ISIS — entitled A Second Message to America — Sotloff appears dressed in an orange jumpsuit before he is executed by an ISIS member. Sotloff was kidnapped by militants upon crossing into Syria a little more than a year ago. He had been freelancing for Time and Foreign Policy magazines. Last week his mother made an emotional plea to his captors and the Islamic States self proclaimed caliph Abu Bakr al Baghdadi. US officials have said that Sotloff and Foley were among fewer than 10 Westerners being held hostage by the group. When asked again on Tuesday Psaki said a few US citizens were being held by ISIS. This is a breaking news story and will be updated as we learn more information. SEE ALSO Obama ISIS Is A Cancer That Has No Place In The 21st Century
2011,New York based technology giant IBM has denied rumors that it is going to cut 26 percent of its workforce. The firm said the rumors that over 100000 jobs will be cut is totally ludicrous. It said the company would take a US 600 million charge for restructuring. that is several thousand people. Not 10000 or 100000 it said in a statement. IBM also noted that it currently has job postings for more than 10000 professionals worldwide with more than half of them in growth areas such as cloud analytics security and mobile technologies. The company has logged US 25 billion in revenue last year up 16 percent from 2013. Pre tax profit amounted to US 21 billion it said

2355,Women with attractive eyes may be forced to cover them up under Saudi Arabias latest repressive measure it was reported yesterday. The ultra conservative Islamic state has said it has the right to stop women revealing tempting eyes in public. A spokesperson for Saudi Arabias Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice Sheikh Motlab al Nabet said a proposal to enshrine the measure in law has been tabled. Tempting eyes Muslim women could be forced to cover up even their eyes if a right of the Saudi state is enforced Women in Saudi Arabia already have to wear a long black cloak called an abaya cover their hair and in some regions conceal their faces while in public. If they do not they face punishments including fines and public floggings. One report on the Bikya Masr news website suggested the proposal was made after a member of the committee was attracted by a womans eyes as he walked along a street provoking a fight. The woman was walking with her husband who ended up being stabbed twice in the hand after the altercation. The virtue and vice committee has repeatedly been accused of human rights violations. Founded in 1940 its function is to ensure Islamic laws are not broken in public in Saudi Arabia. In 2002 the committee refused to allow female students out of a burning school in the holy city of Mecca because they were not wearing correct head cover. The decision is thought to have contributed to the high death toll of 15. They are also banned from driving by religious edict and can not travel without authorisation from their male guardians. In September a Saudi women sentenced to 10 lashes for defying the driving ban was only spared when King Abdullah stepped in to stop the public flogging. Also in September the king announced that women would be given the right to vote for the first time and run in the countrys 2015 local elections
2363,The Iraqi Parliaments National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL Head of the committee Hakem al Zameli said according to the Arabic language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. The incident was reported by foreign and alternative media but not mentioned by the establishment media in the US Europe. Hakem al Zameli a senior Iraqi legislator added that the current government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from security forces in al Anbar province about flights airdropping weapons to ISIS. He said the US wants to promote chaos in Iraq and does this by supporting the Islamic State. Other Iraqi lawmakers are complaining about the situation. We have discovered weapons made in the US European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISILs control in Al Baqdadi region the al Ahad news website quoted the head of the al Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying. Weapons made in Europe and Israel were also discovered in Ramadi Tarmouz said. The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations he said. In December Iranian state media claimed US military aircraft dropped weapons in areas held by the Islamic State for a second time. Infowarscom reported Iraqi volunteers fighting against IS in the Yathrib and Balad districts in Iraqs Salahuddin Province reported the air drops. Iraq claims it now has the upper hand in the battle to regain territory from the terrorist group. In October a purported errant airdrop of weapons fell into the hands Islamic State fighters outside Kobani in Syria. In November Iraqi intelligence sources said the US is actively supplying ISIS with weapons. The Iraqi intelligence sources reiterated that the US military planes have airdropped several aid cargoes for ISIL terrorists to help them resist the siege laid by the Iraqi army security and popular forces a report stated. What is important is that the US sends these weapons to only those that cooperate with the Pentagon and this indicates that the US plays a role in arming the ISIL. In July Infowarscom reported on the large amount of US weapons captured by ISIS. In addition to combat ground vehicles and artillery previously acquired from the Iraqi military the trove taken form US bases included more than 50 155mm M 198 artillery batteries and 4000 PKC machine guns. The acquisition of sophisticated weapons converted ISIS from a terrorist group into an army capable of waging conventional war in Iraq and Syria
1229,Apple is forecast to have shipped a whopping 73 million iPhones over the 2014 holiday quarter on strong iPhone 6 demand according to one well connected analyst who also expects a busy start to 2015 for the company with Apple Watch sales in March and a rumored 12 inch MacBook Air coming sometime before April. In a research note from well connected KGI analyst Ming Chi Kuo obtained by AppleInsider Apples latest iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models led a charge to 73 million overall unit sales for the quarter ending December. The analyst estimates the 47 inch iPhone 6 to hit more than 42 million while the larger 55 inch iPhone 6 phablet contributed with just over 16 million unit sales. If the numbers hold up Apple is in for a record smashing holiday quarter. Kuos estimates are well above expectations from other leading investment banks including UBS which earlier this month forecast Apple to sell 69 million iPhones. Momentum from Apples iPhone 6 lineup will spill into the first quarter driving overall iPhone shipments to an about 617 million unit sales. A performance of that caliber would buffer seasonally slow sales. Consistent with the latest reports Kuo also expects the highly anticipated Apple Watch to launch in March. While Apple has stayed mum on exact specifications the company could fill in the blanks with a special announcement prior to the devices debut the analyst said. Assuming a March launch Apple Watch is expected to sell 28 million units in the first quarter meaning those sales will be spread across a relatively short one month span. Kuo says most component suppliers will see shipments in the 4 million to 5 million unit range through the March quarter but a few manufacturers are seeing low yields on key parts slowing down final assembly and shipping. On Apples rumored 12 inch MacBook Air with Retina display Kuo is forecasting a ship by date sometime this quarter. The all new thin and light said to sport a Retina display ultra thin form factor and Intels latest mobile chips will help fuel a 26 percent quarter over quarter increase in Mac shipments. Kuo expects Mac sales to hit 6 million units for the first three months of 2015 up slightly from 59 million forecast for Q4 2014. Aside from industry scuttlebutt not much is known about Apples ultraportable newcomer. A set of photos posted online yesterday purportedly show the laptops display assembly which boasts edge to edge glass with black bezels and eschews the usual translucent Apple logo for a polished insert more in line with the latest iOS devices. Finally Kuo sees drooping sell through for iPad as Apples recently released iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 models largely failed to move the needle during the holiday season. For the December quarter estimates put iPad shipments down 178 percent year over year to 214 million units. Moving into the first quarter of 2015 iPad could hit 101 million unit sales but the number is still weak down 38 percent compared to the same time last year. Interestingly Kuo models a rise in shipments for older iPad versions during the March quarter while at the same time revising down previous estimates of iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3. The analyst adjusted his numbers to reflect challenges Apples tablet is facing with shifting market headwinds
245,Saudia the national airline is said to be planning to ensure men and women are seated apart on its aeroplanes The national airline of Saudi Arabia could be set to segregate sexes on board its flights amid claims men have lodged complaints about male strangers sitting next to their wives. Saudia will order staff to keep men and women seated apart on its aeroplanes unless they are close relatives according the news website Emirates247.

The vast majority of Gulf operated airlines abide by Islamic laws but vary in their strictness. Poll loading …
246,So much for Tesla bringing its 5 billion battery factory to southern Dallas County. According to The Wall Street Journal the company has decided to take its operations to Nevada. A press conference is allegedly scheduled in Carson City tomorrow. Per MarketWatch Tesla said last month it had broken ground on a site in Storey County east of Reno but added that it will still be looking at other sites in other states as a final location would depend on what agreements and incentives it could get from whichever state it chooses. In July Tesla spokeswoman Alexis Georgeson said the company was looking at a bunch of different locations and have not confirmed anything. But in recent days and weeks it became increasingly clear Nevada was the clear favorite. Earlier this week the Associated Press broke down the incentives that could have been offered by some of the contenders Texas among them. But Nevada had some significant advantages among them proximity to the assembly plant in Fremont California where Tesla makes its cars significant deposit of lithium which is essential to making the batteries said the AP report. that is a go but they are still negotiating the specifics of the contract a source within the Nevadas governors office told CNBCcom Wednesday concerning tomorrows alleged announcement. CNBC reported that the source noted it could be a week before the deal is official. it is expected to bring with it 6500 jobs. Of course Texas had a few things working in its favor — chief among them this is a right to work state. But CEO Elon Musk does not care for Texas laws that prevent Tesla from selling its car directly to customers without first passing through a dealership. Messages have been left for Tesla officials
561,Tampa Fla – A Tampa massage therapist who calls herself Jasmine Tridevil says she spent 20000 on a procedure to add a third breast to her chest. The Florida woman told a Florida radio station that she called like 50 or 60 doctors in order to have the surgery adding a third breast. The 21 year old says she saved up for two years for the surgery that she hopes will land her a reality television show on MTV. Tridevil says it is not just fame and fortune that pushed her to have the surgery – it was also a desire to rebuff men My whole dream is to get this show on MTV she told Real Radio. I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I do not want to date anymore… Most guys would think the extra breast is weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes I can still you know… feel pretty. I am dumping every penny I have into this. If this does not work I am through. Last month she uploaded a YouTube video of herself modeling in a bikini as Radioheads Creep plays in the background. Her Jasmine Tridevil social media accounts on Twitter and Instagram have received reactions of disbelief – and support — at her selfie photographs featuring her in bikinis and other outfits displaying her third breast. She said she made many of her own outfits for herself. Tridevil received the surgery a few months prior although it was really hard finding someone that would do it because they are breaking the code of ethics she said. The third breast was constructed in the middle of her chest with a silicone implant and skin tissue that was cut from her abdomen. She signed a non disclosure agreement with the doctor who performed the surgery. Although the surgeon was unable to make an artificial areola Tridevil says she fixed that by having it made in a tattoo. Tridevil said she was filmed when she told her parents about the surgery in hopes that the video will be featured on her own reality show. She says she personally hired the camera crew to film her after more than two years of saving money. My mum ran out the door. She will not talk to me. She will not let my sister talk to me. My dad … he really is not happy … he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it she said. My dad is still there for me. – Benjamin Fearnow
131,The Islamic State group is allegedly closing in on Baghdad according to a report from a vicar at Iraqs only Anglican church that claims the jihadists formerly known as ISIS are roughly one mile away from the Iraqi capital. Airstrikes against ISIS targets were supposed to stop the group from taking Baghdad. The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad. They said it could never happen and now it almost has Canon Andrew White of the Foundation for Relief and Reconciliation in the Middle East a British based charity that supports Iraqs only Anglican church in Baghdad said on his Facebook page early Monday morning. Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to be here a very short while to know they can do very very little. The Christian aid group was referring to the US presidents interview Sunday night on 60 Minutes the CBS news magazine show where Obama conceded that his administration underestimated the ascendancy of ISIS. More than 1000 Iraqi troops were reportedly killed Sunday in clashes with ISIS about 10 miles outside of Baghdad. The advance by ISIS toward Baghdad shows that the group is not weakening despite US led airstrikes in Iraq. ISIS executed 300 Iraqi soldiers last week during their march toward the Iraqi capital and attempted to break into a prison in northern Baghdad. This attack is very significant. It is the first infantry like complex and penetrating attack in Baghdad city by ISIS since the fall of Mosul in June of this year the Washington based nonprofit Institute for the Study of War wrote on its website referring to Iraqs second largest city which is in the Islamic States hands. ISIS likely carried out the attack to release some of the pressure it is facing as a result of the recent US air campaign targeting its positions. The attack also signifies that despite the heightened defenses of Baghdad in the aftermath of the fall of Mosul ISIS is still able to carry out attacks in an area where it is unlikely to have active sleeper cells. US led airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria have come under criticism over their effectiveness. US Secretary of State John Kerry defended the military action last week in a CNN interview. Kerry claimed Baghdad could have fallen if it were not for the airstrikes which have predominantly been launched in the northern part of Iraq
191,A heartwarming letter of support written by a nine year old to her primary school teacher has swept the internet. The British student wrote the tearjerker note after the teacher told her class that he was gay. The man who has preferred to stay anonymous told the website PinkNews that he decided to come out to his pupils after learning that all of the class had heard the word gay used as an insult. The note that a British student wrote to her teacher after he told her class that he was gay. The man came out after learning every pupil had heard gay used as an insult He was stunned to receive the letter from the child afterwards which described him as fantastic and awesome. It read in full Dear Mr R Even though you are gay I will always treat you the same way as I do now. I still think about you the same way as I used to. you are a great teacher and these are just some of the words that I would describe you as great amazing fantastic brilliant awesome and brave. The reason why I say brave is because you shared a personal secret which was very brave. You do not have to feel scared because I know that everyone in the class feels the same way as I do. From A x x PS. We are all proud of you The teacher then shared the letter on social media. He told PinkNews As a primary school teacher I had always worried about mentioning my sexuality despite the fact that my colleagues talked about their husbands wives and significant others all the time. Then as part of anti bullying week I had asked whod heard gay being used as an insult. Almost every one of my class put their hands up. I was stunned. The teacher who preferred to stay anonymous said that he welled up after reading the letter He continued Then I asked who thought that people who were gay or lesbian were bad or wrong in some way again almost every hand went up. After speaking to my Head who was very supportive we agreed I could tell the class that I am gay so they at least knew one gay person and hopefully explain that when people use that word they are talking about me. The reaction was fantastic – there were a lot of gasps and shocked looks and some basic questions – do you have a boyfriend etc – but after a couple of minutes they were over it and we moved on to the rest of the lesson. The letter came a couple of days later. The little girl who wrote it gave it to me at the start of the day with all the other slips about dinner money school trips and doctors appointments. Reading it brought tears to my eyes and it took me a little while to compose myself. When I thanked her she just shrugged and repeated something one of the boys in the class had said during the lesson it is just your life. Then she went back to her maths. For my class it was a surprise sure but to them it was just something simple and easy to file away as another piece of information. There was no judgement no follow up just acceptance. Now I can mention my fiance as easily as any other teacher and my class know me a little better. I have had a lot of letters and cards over the years but this one I know I will keep forever
2560,At this point it almost feels like the Washington Post is trolling everyone with the amount of fake news they put out. During the meeting wherein the Washington Post asserted that Jared Kushner proposed a secure line between the Trump administration and Russia it was actually the Russians who proposed it a source close to Kushner informed Fox News. The source alleges that the permanent back channel was never discussed. What really happened was the proposal of a one off call about Syria. Fox News reports A December meeting between Jared Kushner President Donald Trumps son in law and one of the senior advisers in the Trump administration and Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak at Trump Tower focused on Syria a source familiar with the matter told Fox News Monday. During the meeting the Russians broached the idea of using a secure line between the Trump administration and Russia not Kushner a source familiar with the matter told Fox News. That follows a recent report from The Washington Post alleging that Kushner wanted to develop a secure private line with Russia. The idea of a permanent back channel was never discussed according to the source. Instead only a one off for a call about Syria was raised in the conversation. In addition the source told Fox News the December meeting focused on Russias contention the Obama administrations policy on Syria was deeply flawed. . . . Kushner suggested the use of Russian diplomatic facilities as a way to shield pre inauguration discussions with Kislyak from monitoring according to The Post. The fake news from the Washington Post just keeps coming and yet they are never to be held accountable for some reason. You can watch a Fox News video below wherein they discuss the fake news the Washington Post pushed
351,London The British government on Saturday said it had received reports that Jihadi John the British accented Islamic State militant apparently responsible for the beheading of western hostages had been injured in a US air strike. The Foreign Office could not confirm reports published in the Mail on Sunday that the masked executioner who has appeared in a series of grisly videos posted online had been wounded while attending a meeting of IS leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last week. According to the paper he was rushed to hospital following the US led attack on a bunker in Al Qaim western Iraq on Saturday that killed around 10 IS commanders and wounded 40 more. The Mail reported that it was the same attack that injured elusive IS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi sparking initial rumours that he had been killed. Jihadi John named after Beatle John Lennon due to his British background is believed to be responsible for the murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid workers David Haines and Allan Henning. Despite being a foreigner the masked assassin who goes by the nomme de guerre Jalman Al Britani has become a leading figure in the Islamist group that swept across Syria and northern Iraq. The Mail claimed that a nurse who treated some of those wounded in the attack said there was a man named Jalman on her list referring to him as the one who slaughtered the journalists. The wounded men were then driven to the ISs Syrian stronghold of Raqa according to the Mails source. British intelligence officers estimate that there are around 500 home grown militants fighting for IS in Syria and Iraq and Prime Minister David Cameron this week announced plans to stop them returning to Britain for two years
1216,That North Korean leader is a mysterious fellow. Quite apart from the mandatory hairstyle the rapid weight gain and the did he or did not he execution games lately the supreme leader has kinda just… disappeared. The usually spotlight loving head of state is not in the press not at events and not at meetings. that is right Kim Jong un has been missing for several weeks and no ones quite sure why. The last time that Kim made a public appearance was Sept 3 when he went to a concert with his wife. Since then the media has not heard a peep from the dictator. According to the AP on Thursday he did not even show up to the reopening of North Koreas Supreme Peoples Assembly a super high level meeting at the Pyongyang parliament. it is the first time he is missed such an important event since 2011 when his father died. There are a lot of questions one could ask about the North Korean dictator. Does he really rule the country or is he simply under the thumb of the intriguing Organization and Guidance Department. Does he really love theme parks and brutal prison camps simultaneously or are the water slides just an image booster. Why would anyone ever want a mushroom flavored sports drink. But the most important question is this Why oh why is he hiding. Here are three reported reasons the North Korean dictator is lying low. Possible Reason No. 1 Cheese Apparently it is true. Several news sources including The Daily Mirror are suggesting that most sinister culprit Emmental. Apparently Kim really really loves the Swiss cheese and has huge amounts imported for his own personal consumption. But it is possible he is been enjoying the delicious snack just a little too enthusiastically — he is gained a lot of weight really quickly and the media noticed that the last time he was in public he was walking with a limp. In other words the North Korean leader may be out of action because he is made himself ill by eating too much cheese. Strangely this is the most endearing I have ever found the dictator. Possible Reason No. 2 Gout Another explanation for the weight gain and limp gout. In fact a type of arthritis gout causes intense pain and sometimes weight gain. Michael Madden a journalist for the 38 North website said that based on his gait it appears he has gout — something due to diet and genetic predisposition that has affected other members of the Kim family. Possible Reason No. 3 Security Of course North Korea always has internal political and military struggles going on and this is not even first time that Kim has lain low — back in 2012 he went missing from the media spotlight for two weeks without any explanation. So some are interpreting his disappearance as nothing more than a precautionary security measure. As Toshimitsu Shigemura a professor at Waseda University in Tokyo told the Daily Telegraph Another reason why Kim may be reluctant to appear in public is the ongoing power struggle inside the North Korean military which means that the situation in Pyongyang is still unstable. it is possible. On Friday state media confirmed for the first time that Kims health is not too good acknowledging that he is been dealing with some discomfort. Hmm seems like a cheese related problem to me.

866,Johannesburg Dog fighters forced children as young as 9 to imitate real dog fights placing bets on which child will cause the most injury through biting and scratching. The horrific form of abuse which shows just how damaging dog fighting can be to children came to light early last year in Ekurhuleni but not much has been done to help the children involved. Inspector Wendy Willson from the special investigations unit at the National Council of SPCAs was called to a school in Springs in June to see if they could do something about the problem there. Willson said the school principal who will not be named to protect the identity of the children was concerned that pupils were returning from breaktime with torn clothing and injuries. Teachers then discovered the children were fighting each other in dog fighting role play while other pupils were placing bets on who would win. The children were doing this because adults were encouraging them at weekends to take part both in actual dog fighting and the role play fighting. IOL st DOGfighting 3 SUPPLIED Willson witnessed the children getting down on all fours – barking growling biting and scratching each other. They rip into each other. The play is aggressive enough to cause each other injury she said. In a video of one fight which was much tamer than what was really happening because the children were asked to provide an example the imitation of dogs is so authentic that if you close your eyes and listen you will think you are listening to real dogs. The children who were bystanders were acting out the role of dog handlers and were betting R2 to R10 on the fights that were taking place. The winner of the fight then gets to mate with a younger child as a reward. Willson was not sure if the mimicry moved on to actual copulation. She said this was in imitation of the best fighting dogs who get to be stud animals and mate with female dogs. it is incredibly disturbing that young children are being forced to be involved in this Willson said. She added that the children had told her that in order to stop being a female dog you have to bring in a younger child to take your place. Willson said the NSPCA had discovered just as they had seen in other areas in which dog fighting had taken hold that violent crime was increasing. The NSPCA removed dogs that were involved in fighting. It also discovered cases of bestiality and other instances of horrific animal cruelty and removed the animals from the situation. Willson said the perpetrators involve children in the theft of the dogs the training and in the actual fights. The children were rewarded either with money or dog food for their own dogs which were used in fights. She said the older the child the less empathetic he or she was. One child had told her It makes me feel like laughing. It makes me feel powerful. The inspector said they had recorded elevated levels of aggression bullying and theft in the children. There had been attacks on teachers causing injuries. I have never seen this before Willson added. I searched for examples of children being used like this internationally and came up with nothing. The Gauteng Department of Education said it had been made aware of these allegations early last year. The department had contacted the SPCA to request their intervention said spokeswoman Phumla Sekhonyane. Willson said the NSPCA had conducted two awareness raising workshops at the Springs school and the local police station involving members of the community principals police the Justice Department and child protection services but while everyone had raised concern nothing significant had been done to help the children. A director of IRS Forensic Investigations Glenda Paul said the matter was of grave concern. It is bad enough that criminals are gambling on animals tearing themselves apart for their sick pleasure but to involve children is pure evil. They are like cogs in a machine Teddy Bear Clinic director Shaheda Omar said it was the first time she had ever heard of the dog fighting role play taking place. I have seen cases where children violate animals and show no remorse but never this Omar said. She said it sounded to her like a situation in which children had unmet emotional needs and they needed to find ways to be in a powerful position. These children are being used. They are like cogs in a machine. I am sure some sort of reward is offered and they are being socialised into that behaviour Omar said. Violence begets violence and the children are learning it from adults. The situation needed urgent systemic intervention and different departments needed to get involved to stop the abuse and the childrens behaviour she said. If nothing is done this will become a breeding ground for sociopaths Omar said. Dirty secret breeding organised crime Dog fighting is defined as a sadistic contest in which two dogs which have been specifically bred and trained to fight are placed in a small arena to fight each other for the entertainment of spectators and for gambling purposes. It is violent organised crime that is often linked to other criminal activities. There are three broad categories of dog fighting Street level dog fighting which is usually linked to gang activities and during which people boast about their dogs strength and fighting ability. Dog fighting as a hobby involves people buying dogs of average ability and entering them in local and regional matches. Professional dog fighting is the most sophisticated of the three and is sometimes conducted at national and international levels. High stake matches featuring experienced fighting dogs with established bloodlines take place. Many children in high crime areas and informal settlementsare exposed to dog fighting intheir neighbourhoods and this routine exposure to unfettered animal abuse and neglect is a major contributing factor in their later manifestation of social deviance. It is well documented that by exposing children to such cruel brutality and repeated violence they become desensitised and tend to perpetuate the cycle of violence as well as promoting insensitivity towards animal suffering an enthusiasm for violence and disrespect for the law.

2428,It was not very long ago that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman was treating talk of expansion as though he was being asked if he had like an epidemic of Ebola. But recently the nature of the rhetoric has changed so much that the question is becoming not if but when. And then the ultimate question. Will they be able to limit the number of new teams to just two. Sources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City. And given how dead set against a team in the gambling haven the commissioner was 10 years ago this move into another player friendly state tax free zone represents a considerable about face indeed. But people have been betting on hockey games for years and to pretend games could not be fixed just as easily anywhere as in Vegas is pretty ridiculous so that posturing has fallen by the wayside. A new team close to the newly renamed Arizona squad and Californias big three is all but assured the only question being when and with which other city. Or should that be plural. With all the activity going on in the Seattle area in the last little bit it would be quite a stretch to imagine that much time and effort being spent by so many wealthy men being frittered away for nothing. At the moment there are no surefire plans to build a new rink but that could change at any time with Vancouver billionaire Victor Coleman among many reportedly showing interest in putting an NHL team into the city. And Bettman has not been visiting there to see if it really does rain a lot. it is been 15 years since the NHL expanded — and given there are 16 teams in the east and just 14 in the west taking in two more teams would certainly seem to make a lot of sense the same amount of sense it made when realignment was first announced. And expanding without the players getting their mitts on any of the money other than the increase in payrolls is surely tempting at least to those owners who remember the hefty cheques they cashed for Columbus and Minnesota. Whereas before the commissioner balked at expansion this is a sample of his more recent verbal footwork there is a lot of interest. we are hearing from multiple groups in Seattle and in Vegas and Kansas City and Quebec City Bettman said to the Tribune while scoping out Target field in Minny for yet another trip to the well of outdoor games. We have not decided to engage in a formal expansion process but we listen to expressions of interest. it is not something we have seriously considered yet. Like hell it is not. they had have to be nuts not to be thinking about it seriously. And since then things have changed for a commissioner who hates to move teams in his league no matter how dire the circumstances might appear — one of the most likable aspects of his regime for most hockey fans. Once the league comes to your area it is going to stay through thick thin and the almost impossible as seems to be the case in Phoenix. But could that long standing policy and loyalty change with the Florida situation. True there is a lease until 2028 but with the Panthers bleeding money even the city of Sunrise can not seem to see the point of carrying on much longer so perhaps one of these new cities could get an existing team after all. And while Kansas City is not really likely to be a serious contender in this expansion soup unless they are going to stretch it to four teams saying no to Quebec City in favour of two more US cities with no proven NHL backgrounds is almost certainly not going to happen. Going back to Minnesota has been a success and there is no question there is more money and corporate backing than ever before in Quebec. Even an expansion team there in a new arena would be virtually assured of sellouts into perpetuity. There will be all manner of bleating about there being insufficient talent of course but even if it is true after such a long wait this trivial detail — which only troubles the fans — is not going to get in the way of a financial windfall like this. And any time the league decides it could use talent they can start doing away with most of the coaches they employ whose chief calling in life is to devise ways to stop offensive players and choke the very life out of the game that is paying their salaries. Expansion will be happening and soon. The only question is how many new cities will be involved

1830,Allegations that Bill Cosby sexually molested several women in his past are now coming out. On Tuesday a website called Hip Hop Hangover wrote about how allegations are out that Bill molested Raven Symone. These two worked together on The Cosby Show and everyone would be shocked to hear this news. Well luckily this one is not true at all. Raven Symone Photo by Rick Diamond View all 20 photos Raven Symone Photo by Neilson BarnardGetty Images for Disney There is no truth at all to these allegations at this time. They say that their source is TMZ but there is nothing on their website about it at all. This site is actually a website that likes to spread hoax and make up fake news. They do this and bring in page views. This time it is working for them because everyone is spreading the news on Facebook. This report says that Raven Symone says that she was drugged and raped years ago. Snopes has also shared that this is a fake story. At this time Raven Symone has not accused him of anything. Wet Paint shared the news that Janice Dickinson is revealing that Bill Cosby molested her as well. This report is a true one so you never know who will come out next. She says that it happened in 1982 when she was contacted by Cosby about a role. She shared that he gave her wine and a pill. Janice remembers him being over her and waking up the next morning with semen between her legs. She says that she did not speak out over fear of being labeled. Janice Dickinson is coming forward because she feels like it is the right thing to do now
67,Mariam Al Mansouris F 16 bombing raids were celebrated in the West But a statement purporting to be from her UAE family has disowned her It attacks her for taking part in the brutal aggression against Syria The female air force pilot whose missions against Isis were dubbed boobs on the ground has reportedly been disowned by her family and labelled an ingrate. Mariam Al Mansouris participation in F 16 bombing raids for the UAE was celebrated in the West but an anonymous statement claiming to be from her family disowned her for taking part in the brutal international aggression against Syria. It also expressed support for the Islamic State saying we are proud of the Sunni heroes in Iraq and the Levant. The brutal terrorist groups original name was the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant or Isil. Courageous Major Mansouri from Abu Dhabi made a remarkable rise through the ranks of the UAE air force. she is pictured here in an F 16 Desert Eagle Major Al Mansouris F 16 fighter was one of several from a group of Arab nations that are blitzing Isis In the name of God All Merciful. O ye who believe. Take not your fathers or your brethren for friends if they favour disbelief over faith. Those of you who taketh them for friends are wrong doers. Quranic verse Renouncement of Mariam Al Mansouri We the Mansouri family in the United Arab Emirates hereby publicly declare that we disown the so called Mariam Al Mansouri as well as anyone taking part in the brutal international aggression against the brotherly Syrian people starting with our ingrate daughter Mariam Al Mansouri. We hereby remind the Muslim nation all over the world of its duty to defend the causes of the nation meaning the Islamic nation and we urge them to take up the jihad holy war for the sake of God to support the blessed Syrian revolution against the descendants of Ibn Al Alqami. Sunni Islamist insurgents refer to the Shia as alqami a reference to Muayyad al Din Muhammad Ibn al Alqami a Shiite minister in the last Abbasid caliphate who purportedly assisted the Mongols in conquering Baghdad in 1258. We call upon all factions and battalions operating on the Syrian battleground to unite and join efforts and forces towards the single objective of overthrowing the monstrous Assad regime perched on the pure and blessed Syrian land. Al Mansouri family in the UAE and abroad takes this opportunity to declare its support for the blessed Syrian revolution and to all free men defending their rights everywhere in the world. Our family is proud of all free men who defend their cause and of all those who take up arms to defend the honour of their nation The Islamic Nation. We are proud of the Sunni heroes in Iraq and the Levant and all those who take up the banner of righteousness wherever they may be. We may not know them but God knows them and would champion them. We ask our countrymen not to burden us with the consequences of the actions of the so called Mariam Al Mansouri. All the honourable members of our family have agreed to this statement. Al Mansouri family. The statement also expressed support for the Syrian revolution according to the Palestinian Wattan news agency. It said We the Mansouri family in the United Arab Emirates hereby publicly declare that we disown the so called Mariam Al Mansouri as well as anyone taking part in the brutal international aggression against the brotherly Syrian people starting with our ingrate daughter Mariam Al Mansouri. We ask our countrymen not to burden us with the consequences of the actions of the so called Mariam Al Mansouri. It continued We call upon all factions on the Syrian battleground to unite and join efforts and forces towards the single objective of overthrowing the monstrous Assad regime. Our family is proud of all free men who defend their cause and of all those who take up arms to defend the honour of their nation the Islamic Nation. We are proud of the Sunni heroes in Iraq and the Levant and all those who take up the banner of righteousness wherever they may be. it is not clear whether the views expressed in the statement represent those of the entire family or indeed if it is genuine. The Mansouri tribe has some influential members including the countrys economics minister but it is also very large – the second biggest in Abu Dhabi the capital of UAE so it certainly can not be assumed that the views expressed in the statement are representative of the whole group. The statement could well have been made anonymously out of fear of punishment as voicing dissent against the UAE government can result in imprisonment. If true the statement will not represent the first time the Mansouri family has been linked to extremism. In January this year high profile lawyer Mohammed al Mansoori was jailed for allegedly trying to set up an international branch of the controversial Muslim Brotherhood in the UAE according to the BBC. Major Mansouri from Abu Dhabi made a remarkable rise through the ranks of the UAE air force. She joined it in 2007 and is now a squadron commander. She is one of eight children and has a degree in English literature. The UAE is known to have the most liberal views on womens rights in the Middle East and Mansouri said that she was treated as an equal by her commanding officers. She told Deraa Al Watan magazine Everybody is required to have the same high level of combat competence. She says that her nearest relatives are supportive of her role in the air force. There was also no difference between men and women with regards to training and assignments she said. Everybody is required to have the same high level of combat competence Earlier this week Fox News host Eric Bolling apologised for calling Major Mansouris missions as boobs on the ground. Major Mansouri from Abu Dhabi made a remarkable rise through the ranks of the UAE air forc A Fox News host has issued an apology after making a sexist comment about a female fighter pilot earlier this week on The Five. During a segment about Maj Mariam Al Mansouri a female pilot from the United Arab Emirates who led a mission this week against ISIS in Syria Eric Bolling referred to her mission as boobs on the ground. Now after outrage from viewers and even his own wife following these insensitive remarks he has apologized. I made a joke and when I got home I got the look and realized some people did not think it was funny at all Bolling said on the air today. I said sorry to my wife and I apologize to all of you as well and want to make that very clear. This all began when Bollings cohost Kimberly Guilfoyle praised Maj Mansouri on the program Wednesday afternoon. Hey ISIS you were bombed by a woman Guilfoyle said. Oh yeah hell came down on ISIS in Syria because guess what the first female pilot piloting for the United Arab Emirates there she was leading the strikes. Dropped the bombs on ISIS Monday night. Maj Mansouri 35 was the first woman to join the Emirati Air Force. This is really incredible Guilfoyle continued. Major Mariam Al Mansouri is who did this. Remarkable very excited. I wish it was an American pilot. I will take a woman doing this any day to them. Right after she said this the men on the panel began making sexist jokes. It comes as Britain Belgium and Denmark on Friday joined the US led coalition of nations that are launching airstrikes on Isis. The European politicians flatly described the moves as critical to security on home soil arguing that facing down terrorists has become a matter of urgency. Prime Minister David Cameron made a passionate plea for action in drastic terms noting that the militants had beheaded their victims gouged out eyes and carried out crucifixions to promote goals from the Dark Ages. This is about psychopathic terrorists that are trying to kill us and we do have to realize that whether we like it or not they have already declared war on us he said. There is not a walk on by option. There is not an option of just hoping this will go away. Cameron told a tense House of Commons during more than six hours of debate that the hallmarks of the campaign would be patience and persistence not shock and awe a reference to the phrase associated with the invasion of Iraq. That unpopular intervention has cast a shadow over the discussions because critics fear that Europe will be drawn into a wider conflict specifically taking on the Islamic groups fighters in Syria. British MPs voted 524 43 for action after being urgently recalled from a recess. Belgian lawmakers also overwhelmingly approved voting 114 2 to take part despite widespread concerns that more terrorism may follow in their homeland as a result. The White House said in a statement that it welcomed the countries to the coalition. These decisions along with those by Saudi Arabia Jordan the United Arab Emirates Bahrain and Qatar to participate in airstrikes against ISIL in Syria demonstrate the clear commitment of the international community to take action together against these terrorists the statement reads
2570,Over the past few years a number of countries have completely banned GMOs and the pesticides that go along with them and they are doing so for a reason. The latest country to consider a complete ban is Russia after top government scientists recommended at least a 10 year ban. The truth is we do not know enough about GMOs to deem them safe for human consumption. Believe it or not the very first commercial sale of them was only twenty years ago. There is no possible way that our health authorities can test all possible combinations on a large enough population over a long enough period of time to be able to say with absolute certainty that they are harmless. There are a multitude of credible scientific studies that clearly demonstrate why GMOs should not be consumed and more are emerging every year. There are also a number of scientists all around the world that oppose them. By slipping it into our food without our knowledge without any indication that there are genetically modified organisms in our food we are now unwittingly part of a massive experimentThe FDA has said that genetically modified organisms are not much different from regular food so they will be treated in the same way. The problem is this geneticists follow the inheritance of genes what biotechnology allows us to do is to take this organism and move it horizontally into a totally unrelated species. Now David Suzuki does not normally mate with a carrot and exchange genes what biotechnology allows us to do is to switch genes from one to the other without regard to the biological constraints. it is very very bad science we assume that the principals governing the inheritance of genes vertically applies when you move genes laterally or horizontally. there is absolutely no reason to make that conclusion – Geneticist David Suzuki If anybody ever tells you that we know with one hundred percent certainty that GMOs are totally safe to eat they have not done their research. There is no reason GM foods should be approved safe for consumption we just do not know enough about them. We could easily feed the planet through organic GMO free methods there is absolutely no reason we need GM foods around. Below I have presented just a bit of information to get you started on your research if you are interested. 1. Multiple Toxins From GMOs Detected In Maternal and Fetal Blood Research from Canada has successfully identified the presence of pesticides associated with genetically modified foods in maternal fetal and non pregnant womens blood. They also found the presence of Monsantos Bt toxin. The study was published in the Journal Reproductive Toxicology in 2011. You can read the FULL study here. Given the potential toxicity of these environmental pollutants and the fragility of the fetus more studies are needed particularly those using the placental transfer approach. Thus our present results will provide baseline data for future studies exploring a new area of research relating to nutrition toxicology and reproduction in women. Today obstetric gynecological disorders that are associated with environmental chemicals are not known. Thus knowing the actual concentration of genetically modified foods in humans constitutes a cornerstone in the advancement of research in this area. The study used blood samples from thirty pregnant women and thirty non pregnant women. The study also pointed out that the fetus is considered to be highly susceptible to the adverse affects of xenobiotics This is why the study emphasizes that knowing more about GMOs is crucial because environmental agents could disrupt the biological events that are required to ensure normal growth and development. 2. DNA From Genetically Modified Crops Can Be Transferred Into Humans Who Eat Them In a new study published in the peer reviewed Public Library of Science researchersemphasize that there is sufficient evidence that meal derived DNA fragments carry complete genes that can enter into the human circulation system through an unknown mechanism. In one of the blood samples the relative concentration of plant DNA is higher than the human DNA. The study was based on the analysis of over 1000 human samples from four independent studies. PLOS is an open access well respected peer reviewed scientific journal that covers primary research from disciplines within science and medicine. it is great to see this study published in it confirming what many have been suspected for years. Our bloodstream is considered to be an environment well separated from the outside world and the digestive tract. According to the standard paradigm large macromolecules consumed with food can not pass directly to the circulatory system. During digestion proteins and DNA are thought to be degraded into small constituents amino acids and nucleic acids respectively and then absorbed by a complex active process and distributed to various parts of the body through the circulation system. Here based on the analysis of over 1000 human samples from four independent studies we report evidence that meal derived DNA fragments which are large enough to carry complete genes can avoid degradation and through an unknown mechanism enter the human circulation system. In one of the blood samples the relative concentration of plant DNA is higher than the human DNA. The plant DNA concentration shows a surprisingly precise log normal distribution in the plasma samples while non plasma control sample was found to be free of plant DNA. This still does not mean that GMOs can enter into our cells but given the fact GMOs have been linked to cancer it is safe to assume it is indeed a possibility. The bottom line is that we do not know and this study demonstrates another cause for concern. 3. New Study Links GMOs To Gluten Disorders That Affect 18 Million Americans This study was recently released by the Institute for Responsible Technology and uses data from the US department of Agriculture US Environmental Protection Agency medical journal reviews as well as other independent research. The authors relate GM foods to five conditions that may either trigger or exacerbate gluten related disorders including the autoimmune disorder Celiac Disease Intestinal permeability Imbalanced gut bacteria Immune activation and allergic response Impaired digestion Damage to the intestinal wall The Institute for Responsible technology is a world leader in educating policy makers and the public about GMO foods and crops. The institute reports and investigates on the impact GM foods can have on health environment agriculture and more. 4. Study Links Genetically Modified Corn to Rat Tumors In November 2012 The Journal of Food and Chemical Toxicology published a paper titled Long term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup tolerant genetically modified maize by Gilles Eric Seralini and his team of researchers at Frances Caen University. It was a very significant study which obviously looks bad for the big bio tech companies like Monsanto being the first and only long term study under controlled conditions examining the possible effects of a diet of GMO maize treated with Monsanto roundup herbicide. This study has since been retracted which is odd because the journal it was published in is a very well known reputable peer reviewed scientific journal. In order for a study to be published here it has to go through a rigorous review process. it is also important to note that hundreds of scientists from around the world have condemned the retraction of the study. This study was done by experts and a correlation between GMOs and these tumors can not be denied something happened. The multiple criticisms of the study have also been answered by the team of researchers that conducted the study. You can read them and find out more about the study here. GM Crop Production is Lowering US Yields and Increasing Pesticide Use 5. Glyphosate Induces Human Breast Cancer Cells Growth via Estrogen Receptors A study is published in the US National Library of Medicine and will soon be published in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology. Several recent studies showed glyphosates potential to be an endocrine disruptor. Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that can interfere with the hormone system in mammals. These disruptors can cause developmental disorders birth defects and cancer tumors. Glyphosate exerted proliferative effects only in human hormone dependent breast cancer. We found that glyphosate exhibited a weaker estrogenic activity than estradiol. Furthermore this study demonstrated the additive estrogenic effects of glyphosate and genisein which implied that the use of contaminated soybean products as dietary supplements may pose a risk of breast cancer because of their potential additive estrogenicity. Researchers also determined that Monsantos roundup is considered an xenoestrogen which is a foreign estrogen that mimics real estrogen in our bodies. This can cause a number of problems that include an increased risk of various cancers early onset of puberty thyroid issues infertility and more. 6. Glyphosate Linked To Birth Defects A group of scientists put together a comprehensive review of existing data that shows how European regulators have known that Monsantos glyphosate causes a number of birth malformations since at least 2002. Regulators misled the public about glyphosates safety and in Germany the Federal Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety told the European Commission that there was no evidence to suggest that glyphosate causes birth defects. Our examination of the evidence leads us to the conclusion that the current approval of glyphosate and Roundup is deeply flawed and unreliable. In this report we examine the industry studies and regulatory documents that led to the approval of glyphosate. We show that industry and regulators knew as long ago as the 1980s and 1990s that glyphosate causes malformation – but that this information was not made public. We demonstrate how EU regulators reasoned their way from clear evidence of glyphosates teratogenicity in industrys own studies to a conclusion that minimized these findings in the EU Commissions final review report Here is a summary of the report Multiple peer reviewed scientific literature documenting serious health hazards posed by glyphosate Industry has known since the 1980 s that glyphosate causes malformations in experimental animals at high doses Industry has known since 1993 that these effects could also occur at lower and mid doses The German government has known since at least 1998 that glyphosate causes malformations The EU Commissions expert scientific review panel knew in 1999 that glyphosate causes malformations The EU Commission has known since 2002 that glyphosate causes malformations. This was the year DG SANCO division published its final review report laying out the basis for the current approval of glyphosate Another study published by the American Chemical Society from the university of Buenos Aires Argentina also showed that Glyphosate can cause abnormalities. The direct effect of glyphosate on early mechanisms of morphogenesis in vertebrate embryos opens concerns about the clinical findings from human offspring in populations exposed to glyphosate in agricultural fields 7. Study Links Glyphosate To Autism Parkinsons and Alzheimers When you ingest Glyphosate you are in essence altering the chemistry of your body. it is completely unnatural and the body does not resonate with it. P450 is the gene pathway disrupted when the body takes in Glyphosate. P450 creates enzymes that assist with the formation of molecules in cells as well as breaking them down. CYP enzymes are abundant and have many important functions. They are responsible for detoxifying xenobiotics from the body things like the various chemicals found in pesticides drugs and carcinogens. Glyphosate inhibits the CYP enzymes. The CYP pathway is critical for normal natural functioning of multiple biological systems within our bodies. Because humans thatve been exposed to glyphosate have a drop in amino acid tryptophan levels they do not have the necessary active signalling of the neurotransmitter serotonin which is associated with weight gain depression and Alzheimers disease. 8. Chronically Ill Humans Have Higher Glyphosate Levels Than Healthy Humans A new study out of Germany concludes that Glyphosate residue could reach humans and animals through feed and can be excreted in urine. It outlines how presence of glyphosate in urine and its accumulation in animal tissues is alarming even at low concentrations. To this day Monsanto continues to advertise its Roundup products as environmentally friendly and claims that neither animals nor humans are affected by this toxin. Environmentalists veterinarians medical doctors and scientists however have raised increasing alarms about the danger of glyphosate in the animal and human food chain as well as the environment. The fact that glyphosate has been found in animals and humans is of great concern. In search for the causes of serious diseases amongst entire herds of animals in northern Germany especially cattle glyphosate has repeatedly been detected in the urine feces milk and feed of the animals. Even more alarming glyphosate was detected in the urine of the farmers. 9. Studies Link GMO Animal Feed to Severe Stomach Inflammation and Enlarged Uteri in Pigs A study by scientist Judy Carman PhD that was recently published in the peer reviewed journal Organic Systems outlines the effects of a diet mixed with GMO feed for pigs and how it is a cause for concern when it comes to health. Scientists randomized and fed isowean pigs either a mixed GM soy and GM corn diet for approximately 23 weeks which is unfortunately the normal lifespan of a commercial pig from weaning to slaughter. Equal numbers of male and female pigs were present in each group. The GM diet was associated with gastric and uterine differences in pigs. GM pigs had uteri that were 25 heavier than non GM fed pigs. GM fed pigs had a higher rate of severe stomach inflammation with a rate of 32 compared to 125 of non GM fed pigs. The study concluded that pigs fed a GMO diet exhibited a heavier uteri and a higher rate of severe stomach inflammation than pigs who were not fed a GMO diet. Because the use of GMO feed for livestock and humans is so widespread this is definitely another cause for concern when it comes to GMO consumption. Humans have a similar gastrointestinal tract to pigs and these GM crops are consumed widely by people especially in the United States. 10. GMO risk assessment is based on very little scientific evidence in the sense that the testing methods recommended are not adequate to ensure safety. Deficiencies have been revealed numerous times with regards to testing GM foods. The first guidelines were originally designed to regulate the introduction of GM microbes and plants into the environment with no attention being paid to food safety concerns. However they have been widely cited as adding authoritative scientific support to food safety assessment. Additionally the Statement of Policy released by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States presumptively recognizing the GM foods as GRAS was prepared while there were critical guidelines prepared by the International Life Sciences Institute Europe and FAOWHO recommend that safety evaluation should be based on the concept of substantial equivalence considering parameters such as molecular characterization phenotypic characteristics key nutrients toxicants and allergens. Since 2003 official standards for food safety assessment have been published by the Codex Alimentarius Commission of FAOWHO. Published reviews with around 25 peer reviewed studies have found that despite the guidelines the risk assessment of GM foods has not followed a defined prototype. The risk assessment of genetically modified crops for human nutrition and health has not been systematic. Evaluations for each GM crop or trait have been conducted using different feeding periods animal models and parameters. The most common results is that GM and conventional sources include similar nutritional performance and growth in animals. However adverse microscopic and molecular effects of some GM foods in different organs or tissues have been reported. While there are currently no standardized methods to evaluate the safety of GM foods attempts towards harmonization are on the way. More scientific effort is necessary in order to build confidence in the evaluation and acceptance of GM foods. So if anybody ever tells you that GMOs are completely safe for consumption it is not true. We just do not know enough about them to make such a definitive statement. A lot of evidence actually points to the contrary.

1031,e Islamic State militant group released a video today purporting to show the beheading of US hostage Steven J Sotloff. A masked figure in the video also issued a threat against a British hostage a man the group named as David Haines and warned governments to back off this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State the SITE Intelligence Group monitoring service said. Sotloff a freelance journalist was kidnapped in Syria in August 2013. Sotloffs mother Shirley appealed on Aug 27 in a videotaped message to Islamic States self proclaimed caliph Abu Bakr al Baghdadi for her sons release. The White House said it could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters in a briefing that if there is such a video it would be analyzed very carefully adding that the administrations thoughts and prayers were with Sotloffs family. Shortly before the briefing the SITE monitoring service said the militant group had released the video. On Aug 19 the group published a video showing the beheading of US hostage James Foley a Marquette and Northwestern alum. The group said his death was in retaliation for US airstrikes on fighters in Iraq. That video was issued after the United States resumed air strikes in Iraq in August for the first time since the end of the US occupation in 2011. US. HOSTAGES lRelated US military tried but failed to rescue James Foley and other American hostages NATION WORLD US military tried but failed to rescue James Foley and other American hostages SEE ALL RELATED 8 After Islamic States beheading of journalist James Foley President Barack Obamas administration is making little headway in efforts to secure the release of other Americans held by the insurgent group in Syria officials said. The US government has said it does not pay ransoms or negotiate with the Islamic State. Washington has contacted about two dozen countries for help in freeing the three but no foreign government appears to have influence over or even significant contact with IS which has declared an Islamic caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria. What we have found is that ISIS is not responsive to outreach said a senior US official speaking on condition of anonymity and using an alternate acronym for the group. Another administration official said Washington was working with other Western countries whose citizens are being held hostage and with Qatar Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates and others in the region thought by the United States to possibly have influence with the groups Al Nusrah and IS. The hostages fate received little public attention until Islamic State posted an online video on Aug 19 showing Foleys beheading. It now presents a frustrating challenge for Obama. Islamic State is far more difficult to deal with than Iran or the militant group Hezbollah which also took Americans captive said Bruce Riedel a former CIA and White House official now at the Brookings Institution think tank. The group wants to terrorize Americans it is not really interested in deals. WHITE HOUSE INVOLVEMENT US officials and supporters of the remaining hostages requested that most details about them and efforts to free them be withheld. One of the other US hostages is a female aid worker age 26 for whom Islamic State has demanded 66 million in ransom according to ABC News. Lisa Monaco Obamas top counter terrorism adviser has been very deeply involved in this the senior US official said. Monaco along with the State Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation has been in contact with hostages families the official said. Caitlin Hayden a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council said The Administration has had regular interactions with the families of those Americans who have been held hostage in Syria since the kidnapping of their loved ones. These interactions included representatives from all the relevant agencies including the Department of State the FBI the Intelligence Community and the White House. Obama authorized a covert raid in Syria in July to rescue Foley and other American hostages but they were not at the site where they were thought to be held. Another rescue attempt would be risky for US special forces and the hostages. The American diplomatic effort also is aimed at persuading European countries not to pay ransoms officials said. US and European officials have said that France Spain and Italy have tolerated or facilitated ransom payments for citizens held in Syria. Islamic State released numerous European journalists this year including two Spaniards in March and four Frenchmen in April. The French government has denied a news report that it paid a ransom to free the four. Spains foreign ministry has not commented on the matter. The US policy of refusing to pay ransoms to discourage further hostage taking is as close as we are likely to come to governments influencing ISIS on the matter of seizing hostages said Paul Pillar a former senior CIA analyst now at Georgetown University. US officials have said that Qatar played a critical role in persuading a rival group in Syria the official al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al Nusra to free American journalist Peter Theo Curtis whom it had been holding since 2012. Qatar is working to help free other Americans held captive in Syria a Gulf source told Reuters but US officials said the Qatari government has little if any leverage with Islamic State. Reuters
1108,Some politicians on the Israeli right have supported al Sisis proposal to extend the Gaza Strip
2544,we have been told that saturated fat is unhealthy. It is claimed to raise cholesterol levels and give us heart attacks. However… many recent studies suggest that the true picture is more complicated than that. This article takes a detailed look at saturated fat and whether it is good or bad for your health. What is Saturated Fat. Fats are macronutrients. That is nutrients that we consume in large amounts and give us energy. Each fat molecule is made of one glycerol molecule and three fatty acids… which can be either saturated monounsaturated or polyunsaturated. What this saturation stuff has to do with is the number of double bonds in the molecule. Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds monounsaturated fatty acids have one double bond and polyunsaturated fatty acids have two or more double bonds. This picture here shows the difference Saturated vs Unsaturated Fatty AcidsPhoto Source. Another way to phrase this is that saturated fatty acids have all their carbon atoms fully saturated with hydrogen atoms. Foods that are high in saturated fat include fatty meats lard full fat dairy products like butter and cream coconuts coconut oil palm oil and dark chocolate. Actually fats contain a combination of different fatty acids. No fat is pure saturated fat or pure mono or polyunsaturated. Even foods like beef also contain a significant amount of mono and polyunsaturated fats. Fats that are mostly saturated tend to be solid at room temperature while fats that are mostly unsaturated are liquid at room temperature. Like other fats saturated fat contains 9 calories per gram. Bottom Line Saturated fats are fats that contain a high proportion of saturated fatty acids which contain no double bonds. Saturated fats are solid at room temperature. Why do People Think That it is Harmful. A Single Butter Curl Back in the 20th century there was a major epidemic of heart disease running rampant in America. It used to be a rare disease but very quickly it skyrocketed and became the number one cause of death… which it still is. Researchers learned that eating saturated fat seemed to increase levels of cholesterol in the bloodstream. This was an important finding at the time because they also knew that having high cholesterol was linked to an increased risk of heart disease. This led to the following assumption being made If saturated fat raises cholesterol and cholesterol causes heart disease then this must mean that saturated fat causes heart disease. However at the time this was not based on any experimental evidence in humans. This hypothesis was based on assumptions observational data and animal studies. The diet heart hypothesis then turned into public policy in 1977 before it was ever proven to be true. Even though we now have plenty of experimental data in humans showing these initial assumptions to be wrong people are still being told to avoid saturated fat in order to reduce heart disease risk. Bottom Line Saturated fats have been assumed to cause heart disease by raising cholesterol in the blood. However no experimental evidence has ever directly linked saturated fat to heart disease. Saturated Fat Can Raise LDL Cholesterol But Also HDL Cholesterol it is important to realize that the word cholesterol is often used inaccurately. Older Male Doctor HDL and LDL the good and bad cholesterols are not actually cholesterol… they are proteins that carry cholesterol around known as lipoproteins. LDL stands for Low Density Lipoprotein and HDL stands for High Density Lipoprotein. All cholesterol is identical. At first scientists only measured Total cholesterol which includes cholesterol within both LDL and HDL. Later they learned that while LDL was linked to increased risk HDL was linked to reduced risk. Total cholesterol is actually a highly flawed marker because it also includes HDL. So having a high HDL actually contributes to a high Total cholesterol. Because saturated fat raised LDL levels it seemed logical to assume that this would increase the risk of heart disease. But scientists mostly ignored the fact that saturated fat also raises HDL. All that being said new research has shown that LDL is not necessarily bad because there are different subtypes of LDL Small dense LDL These are small lipoproteins that can penetrate the arterial wall easily which drives heart disease. Large LDL These lipoproteins are large and fluffy and do not easily penetrate the arteries. The small dense particles are also much more susceptible to becoming oxidized which is a crucial step in the heart disease process. People with mostly small LDL particles have three times greater risk of heart disease compared to those with mostly large LDL particles. So… if we want to reduce our risk of heart disease we want to have mostly large LDL particles and as little of the small ones as possible. Heres an interesting bit of information that is often ignored by mainstream nutritionists… eating saturated fat changes the LDL particles from small dense to Large. What this implies is that even though saturated fat can mildly raise LDL they are changing the LDL to a benign subtype that is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease. Even the effects of saturated fat on LDL are not as dramatic as you may think. Although they increase LDL in the short term plenty of long term observational studies find no link between saturated fat consumption and LDL levels. It also seems to depend on the chain length of the fatty acid. For example palmitic acid may raise LDL while stearic acid does not. Now scientists have realized that it is not just about the LDL concentration or the size of the particles but the number of LDL particles floating in the bloodstream. Low carb diets which tend to be high in saturated fat can lower LDL p while low fat diets can have an adverse effect and raise LDL p. Bottom Line Saturated fats raise HDL cholesterol and change LDL from small dense to Large LDL which is mostly benign. Overall saturated fats do not harm the blood lipid profile like previously believed. Does Saturated Fat Cause Heart Disease. Old Man Taking Pills The supposedly harmful effects of saturated fat are the cornerstone of modern dietary guidelines. Because of that this topic has received enormous amounts of funding. However… despite decades of research and billions of dollars spent scientists still have not been able to demonstrate a clear link. Several recent review studies that combined data from multiple other studies found that there really is no link between saturated fat consumption and heart disease. This includes a review of 21 studies with a total of 347747 participants published in 2010. Their conclusion there is absolutely no association between saturated fat and heart disease. Another review published in 2014 looked at data from 76 studies with a total of 643226 participants. They found no link between saturated fat and heart disease. We also have a systematic review from the Cochrane collaboration which combines data from numerous randomized controlled trials. According to their review published in 2011 reducing saturated fat has no effect on death or death from heart disease. However they found that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats reduced the risk of cardiac events by 14. This does not imply that saturated fats are bad just that certain types of unsaturated fats are protective while saturated fats are neutral. So… the biggest and best studies on saturated fat and heart disease show that there is no direct link. It was a myth all along. Unfortunately the governments and mainstream health organizations seem reluctant to change their minds and continue to promote the old low fat dogma. For more read this review of 5 recent studies on saturated fat and health. Bottom Line The link between saturated fat and heart disease has been studied intensely for decades but the biggest and best studies show that there is no statistically significant association. Does a Diet Low in Saturated Fat Have Any Health Benefits or Help You Live Longer. Frustrated Young Woman With Vegetables on a Plate Several massive studies have been conducted on the low fat diet. This is the diet recommended by the USDA and mainstream health organizations all over the world. The main purpose of this diet is to reduce the intake of saturated fat and cholesterol. This diet also recommends increased consumption of fruits vegetables and whole grains… along with reduced consumption of sugar. The Womens Health Initiative was the biggest nutrition study in history. It was a randomized controlled trial with 46835 women who were instructed to eat a low fat diet. After 75 8 years there was only 04 kg difference in weight and there was zero difference in heart disease cancer or death. Other massive studies have confirmed this… the low fat diet provides no benefit for heart disease or the risk of death. Several studies that replaced saturated fat with polyunsaturated vegetable oils showed that more people in the vegetable oil groups ended up dying. It is interesting to see that since the low fat guidelines came out the prevalence of obesity has skyrocketed Low Fat Guidelines and Obesity Epidemic This graph shows that the obesity epidemic started full force at the same time the low fat advice was peaking. The type 2 diabetes epidemic followed soon after. Of course this graph alone does not prove anything but it does make sense that replacing traditional foods like butter and meat with processed low fat foods high in sugar had something to do with it. it is also interesting when looking at the literature that in almost every single study comparing the expert approved low fat diet to other diets it loses. Bottom Line Studies on the low fat diet do not show a reduced risk of heart disease or death and some studies show that replacing saturated fat with vegetable oils increases the risk. People With Certain Medical Conditions May Want to Minimize Saturated Fat Suspicious Doctor The results of most studies are based on averages. The studies clearly show that on average saturated fat does not raise the risk of heart disease. However within those averages there is room for individual variability. Perhaps most individuals see no effect… while others experience decreased risk and yet others experience an increased risk. That being said there are definitely some people who may want to minimize saturated fat in the diet. This includes individuals with a genetic disorder called Familial Hypercholesterolemia as well as people who have a gene variant called ApoE4. With time the science of genetics will most surely discover more ways in which diet affects our individual risk for disease. Bottom Line Some people may want to minimize saturated fat intake including people with Familial Hypercholesterolemia or a gene called ApoE4. Saturated Fat is Excellent for Cooking and Foods That Are High in it Tend to be Healthy and Nutritious Saturated fat has some important beneficial aspects that are rarely mentioned. Chef Holding Bell Pepper and Meat For example saturated fats are excellent for cooking. Because they have no double bonds they are highly resistant to heat induced damage. Polyunsaturated fats on the other hand easily oxidize when they are heated. For this reason coconut oil lard and butter are all excellent choices for cooking especially for high heat cooking methods like frying. Foods that are naturally high in saturated fat also tend to be healthy and nutritious as long as you are eating quality unprocessed foods. These include naturally fedraised meats dairy products from grass fed cows dark chocolate and coconuts. Bottom Line Saturated fats are excellent cooking fats and foods that are high in saturated fat tend to be both healthy and nutritious. The Bad Fats You Should Avoid Like The Plague Bottles of Vegetable Oil There are many different types of fat. Some of them are good for us others neutral yet others are clearly harmful. The evidence points to saturated and monounsaturated fats being perfectly safe and maybe even downright healthy. However… the situation is a bit more complicated with polyunsaturated fats. When it comes to those we have both Omega 3s and Omega 6s. We need to get these two types of fatty acids in a certain balance but most people are eating way too many Omega 6 fatty acids these days. It is a good idea to eat plenty of Omega 3s but most people would do best by reducing their Omega 6 consumption. The best way to do that is to avoid seed and vegetable oils like soybean and corn oils as well as the processed foods that contain them. Another class of fats artificial trans fats is also very harmful. Trans fats are made by exposing polyunsaturated vegetable oils to a chemical process that involves high heat hydrogen gas and a metal catalyst. Studies show that trans fats lead to insulin resistance inflammation belly fat accumulation and drastically raise the risk of heart disease. So eat your saturated fats monounsaturated fats and Omega 3s… but avoid trans fats and processed vegetable oils like the plague. Bottom Line The truly harmful fats are artificial trans fats and processed vegetable oils high in Omega 6 fatty acids. Blaming New Health Problems on Old Foods does not Make Sense The health authorities have spent an immense amount of resources studying the link between saturated fat and heart disease. Despite thousands of scientists decades of work and billions of dollars spent this hypothesis still has not been supported by any good evidence. The saturated fat myth was not proven in the past is not proven today and never will be proven… because it is just flat out wrong. Not only is this myth NOT supported by scientific evidence it is easily refuted with some plain common sense… Humans and pre humans have been eating saturated fat for hundreds of thousands of years but the heart disease epidemic started a hundred years ago. Blaming new health problems on old foods just does not make sense

1059,Reports have claimed that Apple is ready to announce an acquisition of Path the struggling social network. Pando citing an anonymous source working in Apples engineering team claims that the social network may be integrated into Apples Messages app. So what will Apple be getting when it acquires Path. Heres a guide. One of Paths most unique features is just how much power it gives users over who can see their posts. Users are limited to just 150 friends with no option to share posts publicly. As well as sharing posts to their friends Path users can also create an Inner Circle of friends who can see their most private posts. Path is often praised for its design with Apple even featuring the social network in keynote slides. The app includes minimalist navigation icons and clock hands that spin as you scroll through the timeline. Apples short lived iTunes Ping service allowed users to share the music they were listening to as well as keep track of famous musicians. Shuttered two years after its launch the app failed to gain a significant number of users. But a major feature of Path is very similar to Apples Ping service. The app offers the ability to share what music you are listening to with friends. One of Paths more unique features is the ability to share what times you go to sleep and wake up. Tap the sleep button and Path will ask you whether you are conscious or not. Select Go to Sleep and the app shows a night sky and a moon to get you in the mood. When you wake up tap the Awake button next to the sun icon to inform all of your Path friends that you are awake. Paths latest update was the launch of a new messaging app in June. Path Talk lets you messages your Path friends as well as share a whole load of information about yourself through the app. As well as sensing when you are traveling on trains and in cars the app can also continually broadcast your battery level. Currently Path earns money by selling virtual stickers and photo filters. The app also sells a Premium subscription that gives you unlimited virtual stickers and photo filters.

Just as he extended his arms to do that Kishore had an epileptic fit falling to the ground in front of the whole gathering. The young bride angry that her family had been kept in the dark about Kishores medical condition promptly changed her mind and announced that she would happily marry at the same ceremony a guest at the wedding a man called Harpal Singh. The latter incidentally turned out to be her sisters brother in law. Singh caught unawares and dressed in jeans and a leather jacket fumbled for a moment before declaring he would willingly take Indira as his wife. This time the varmala was exchanged between Singh and Indira which went off without any hitch with the pandit reciting the mantras and asking the new couple to take the seven pheras. Meanwhile Kishore who had been rushed to a doctor by his relatives went back to the venue after he regained consciousness to see that his wife to be was now someone elses. Kishore pleaded with Indira telling her that he would not be able to face friends and neighbours if he returned without her. His relatives too tried to intervene on his behalf. Where persuasion failed violence was used — spoons plates and dishes became weapons as wedding guests tried to force the bride to change her mind. But all in vain. The young woman stood firm. Kishore and his relatives later filed an FIR at the Milak police station in Rampur district which they eventually withdrew after elders intervened. SHO Milak police station RP Solanki said on Monday that cops had detained a few people who were there at the wedding. Both families have amicably resolved the matter Solanki said. The complaints have been withdrawn. Kishore and his family have now returned in peace to Moradabad

1264,Argentinas president adopted a Jewish godson under a law intended to counteract an old legend about werewolves. President Christina Fernandez described in seven tweets her meeting with her new godson Yair Tawil a member of a Chabad Lubavitch family. He was adopted as a godson under a law passed in the 1920s. The law was passed in order to counteract a legend that led to the death of Argentine boys. According to the legend the seventh son born after six boys without any girls in between becomes a werewolf whose bite can turn others into a werewolf. The belief in the legend was so widespread that families were abandoning giving up for adoption and even killing their own sons. The law only applied to the biological children of Catholic families until the enacting of a presidential decree in 2009 which allows children from other religions to qualify. The boys receive presidential protection a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until his 21st birthday. Shlomo and Nehama Tawil parents of seven boys in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree and asking for the designation of godson. Yair Tawil on Tuesday became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentinas history. Fernandez received the Yair his parents and three of his brothers in her office where they lit Hanukkah candles together on a Hanukkah menorah from Israel presented to the president by the Tawil family. The president in her tweets and photos described to her 34 million Twitter followers the magical moment with a marvelous family. She described Yair as a total sweety and his mother a Queen Esther. She tweeted that the Tawils are a very special family. They have a sort of peace happiness and a lot of love that is not common. The tweet included a link to the presidential blog which includes more photos from the meeting. Shlomo Tawil is the director of the Chabad House in Rosario located in central Argentina
1694,It is reported from Saudi Arabia that it has introduced a new law which prohibits women from having the tempting eyes. But the news is from 2011 and it seems not even sue. A new law in Saudi Arabia forcing women to wear full veils if their eyes are considered too tempting. It reports the British Metro and refers to a krönikeliknande opinion text from the Assyrian news agency Aina. So writes the Omni in a short news text published on Wednesday evening and join the ranks thus to a wide range of international media and web pages in recent days reported the same news. Including British Metro US news website Inquisitr and Serbian Telegraph. They all use the article from the news agency Aina source. The article is published on October 30 and is as Omni mention written in and colored by a personal tone. But not only that it is also written by the legendary musician Cole Porter who is mentioned in the article but died in 1964. At least according to the articles byline. Old news from 2011 Does this sound fishy. it is weird. In fact namely the full text of the news agency Ainas article copied outright from a post on the site the Daily Beast published on 19 November 2011. Even then in 2011 circulated the news of the Saudi law widely and published among other things the British Daily Mail. The original source of the time seems to have been an article on the site bikyamasrcom. There are today a weird Russian blog titled Business World but through service Internet Archive can the old article from November 16 2011 read. The text sets out no earlier source. So it is a three year old news now circulating as new. This results in multiple abnormalities. Under the text Prince Naif supports the new law links such as Omni to an article published this week on the site firsttoknowcom alleging that Prince Naif the Saudi throne appears to be an equally cruel ruler like his father King Abdullah has spoken out in full support for the new law. But that claim is not particularly new but comes from the publications that were made in 2011 Prince Naif or Nayef bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud as his real name was namely died in 2012. Religious police deny Abdulhadi Khalaf is a lecturer in Sociology at Lund University and expert on the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East and he says he has not heard about this news myself. Later he emailed a link. It is evident that the religious police has denied that it has issued such a law writes Khalaf. The religious police who Khalaf refers to the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of cargo the Saudi authorities who declare that Sharia law is followed. Basically all the articles written about the law as well in 2014 as in 2011 citing a Motlab Sheikh al Nabet to be a spokesperson for CPVPV. But Sheikh Motlab al Nabet exists nowhere on the web in addition to the items on this particular law. And the link that Abdulhadi Khalaf find goes to an article that is published on the Saudi news website Hail News that Abdulhadi Khalaf says is credible information relating to the Saudi authorities. There CPVPV denies the story of the illegal tempting eyes. The article writes Hail News that the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of cargo say they are not issuing any statement which is consistent with yesterdays international spread accusations that they had begun to crack down on women with glamorous eyes. Viral examiner fails to reach the Saudi Embassy in Stockholm the Swedish embassy in Riyadh the Saudi capital claims not to have heard of the law. Swedish Embassy in Rijad had no knowledge of it says the Foreign Ministrys press service to Viral Browser

2065,The son of an aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong uns uncle is in hiding in France after evading abduction by agents of the Communist regime foreign diplomatic sources believe. There was an attempt to force him to go back but it is thought he escaped and is somewhere in France. There is an attempt to locate him but he has not been found yet said the diplomatic source. The architecture student referred to only by his surname Han went missing last month raising concerns for his safety. He is believed to be the son of a close confidant of Jang Song thaek Kim Jong uns once powerful uncle who was executed in December last year on treason charges. Hans father is known to have been killed recently as part of a Kim regime purge of Jang allies. Park Sung jin Paris correspondent for Yonhap South Koreas biggest news agency which broke the story said Since the 1980s when the regime changes and someone is executed and his relatives and friends and family are studying abroad they are brought home. If Han returned he would likely be kept in a political prison or executed. That has happened many times. He knew what was awaiting him so he escaped. Hans curious disappearance which comes amid heightened tensions between North Korea and America over the Sony Entertainment Pictures hacking scandal has lifted the lid on the murky ties France keeps with the Communist regime. Despite having no official diplomatic relations with the dictatorship France has been behind a discreet student programme in place since 2002 in which North Korean students from privileged backgrounds study architecture in Paris. The stated aim is for them to return to Pyongyang and launch grandiose architectural projects to the glory of the dictatorship. Han was studying at Paris prestigious Ecole Nationale Superieure dArchitecture de Paris La Villette. He had left North Korea for Paris in 2012 along with nine other North Koreans five of whom are posted at another architecture school in Belleville. They are in their third year of a five year course. We did not decide out of the blue to take on students from North Korea the decision was made by the French culture ministry to whom we answer. This is over our heads said a head teacher at the La Villette school who recalled her surprise when the first batch of students turned up wearing badges with the effigy of their Dear Leader. The students are kept under close surveillance she told The Telegraph. There is often an Asian man in a three piece suit waiting in the courtyard checking up on attendance and if they get good results she said. When one failed part of his exam and was sent home a representative from the North Korean delegation in Paris wanted to take it in his place. We had to explain that was not possible she added. After long denying its existence the French foreign ministry confirmed to The Telegraph that a cooperation programme involving students from North Korea trained in architecture in Paris has been in place for the past decade. It had no further comment. The programme was set up by Jean Noël Juttet a former French ambassador to Japan who said he was asked by the French foreign ministry to find ways of maintaining contact between the two countries. Homing in on education he said the French suggested courses in priority sectors like medicine food or construction but that the North Koreans were only interested in one field architecture. That was a request that came all the way from the top. They insisted so much that we ended up agreeing he told Street Press an online news site that first uncovered the student programme. Trained in France the land of star architects like Jean Nouvel the students are supposed to help transform Pyongyangs skyline with new cutting edge architectural designs such as the Ryugyong hotel a 330 metre high edifice completed in 2012. They have reportedly been behind designs for a new ice skating rink dolphinarium and sports centre opened last year to help North Korea become a new society of leisure. Architecture is not Kim Jong uns only area of interest in France. In April it also emerged that the Emmental loving despot had ordered three officials to attend a crash course in cheese making at a dairy school in eastern France reportedly because he was dissatisfied with his countrys attempts at dairy production. The school politely declined. France has historically kept relatively warm ties with Communist nations including China. In 2011 it emerged that a French neurosurgeon Francois Xavier Roux had secretly treated Kim Jong il the former North Korean leader in 2008 after he had a stroke. Describing Kim as apparently profoundly Francophile Dr Roux said He wanted to establish political ties with France. He was not hiding that. He also knew French cinema very well. I was pretty surprised. He knew French wines pretty well. We were talking about the differences between Bourgogne and Bordeaux etc. Last month it was reported that Pyongyang flew in a French surgeon to operate on Kim Jong uns feet after state media pictured him walking with a cane. Behind the university exchange lies a complex game of parallel diplomacy according to North Korea expert Pierre Rigoulot. For North Korea the exchanges are a way of legitimising the Pyongyang regime and receiving recognition. The aim for which they will sacrifice anything is to open an embassy in Paris. It would be a small victory for the country he told Street Press. As for France he said it was a way of keeping channels of communication open You can not send information to North Korea so welcoming these young students is a rare opportunity to communicate with the country. In the long term it could be a way of moving things forward. An abduction attempt however if confirmed would definitively scupper any North Korean request for diplomatic recognition from France he said
896,A South Korean woman who was attacked by her robot vacuum cleaner while she slept had to be rescued by emergency services. The woman was taking a nap on the floor of her house in the city of Changwon when the machine turned on her. The automatic vacuum cleaner which she had programmed to clean the room around her apparently mistook her hair for dust and sucked it up the Korea Bizwire website reports. Unable to escape she was forced to call the local fire department with what South Korean newspaper Kyunghyang Shinmun described as a desperate rescue plea according to the The Guardian. The 52 year old woman whose name has not been made public was eventually extracated from the machine and suffered only minor injuries. But while she escaped relatively lightly the incident could provide a peek into a dystopian future in which supposedly benign robots turn against their human masters suggests the Guardian. There is a growing market for consumer robots with the Roomba remote control vacuum cleaner by iRobot selling more than ten million units since it debuted in 2002. Korea Biz Wire points out that people in Korean and Japan where its common to sit sleep and eat on the floor should exercise caution around their household robots. ·
1421,The tradition to stop stigma about the lobison has continued for a century The President of Argentina has adopted a young Jewish man as her godson to stop him turning into a werewolf. President Christina Fernández de Kirchner met Yair Tawil and his family at her office last week to mark the unusual ceremony which dates back more than 100 years. According to Argentinian folklore the seventh son born to a family turns into the feared el lobison. The werewolf like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boys 13th birthday the legend says turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form. Yo no lo sabía pero su visita coincidía con la celebración de Hanukkah. El papá decía que no era una casualidad… pictwittercomo3y5E17Gew As well as feeding on excrement unbaptized babies and the flesh of the recently dead the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite. Fear of the lobison was so rife in 19th Century Argentina that some families abandoned or even murdered baby boys – an atrocity that sparked the unusual Presidential practice of adoption aimed at stopping the deadly stigma. Starting in 1907 the tradition was formally established by a decree in 1973 by Juan Domingo Peron which also extended the practice to baby girls. Tenía razón. Me trajeron de regalo un candelabro de Israel. Me pidieron que encendiera las velas… pictwittercomDVWewmZera Seventh sons or daughters – now much rarer than 100 years ago – gain the President as their official godparent as well as a gold medal and full educational scholarship. Even now reports of dog like creatures attacking livestock continue as does the tradition. Ms Fernandez said Yair is the first Jewish boy to be adopted as the tradition only applied to Catholic children until 2009. She described her meeting with him and his family on 23 December as a magical moment. Calling the Tawils a marvellous family she described Yair as a total sweety and dubbed his mother Queen Esther. Shlomo and Nehama Tawil parents of seven boys had written the President a letter in 1993 and got their wish this year the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported attending the ceremony with their son and three of his brothers. Pictures showed them lighting Hanukkah candles together on a menorah from Israel presented to the president by the Tawil family
2557,President elect Donald J Trump has not been inaugurated yet but he is already backtracking on some of his most high profile campaign positions. The latest walk back concerns global climate change specificallys the agreement that world leaders recently put in place to rein in emissions of planet warming greenhouse gases. In an interview on Tuesday with senior reporters and editors of the New York Times Trump said he has an open mind on whether to pull the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement. I am looking at it very closely he said During the campaign Trump was quite clear on this. During an energy policy speech on May 26 Trump said we are going to cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payment of US tax dollars to UN global warming programs. During UN climate talks that ended this week China emerged as the new leader on the issue if the US were to stop mobilizing international support for climate action as it has under President Obama. The Paris Climate Agreement entered into force on Nov 4 2016 and sets a goal of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius or 36 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels through 2100. It also contains an even more stringent target of 15 degrees Celsius or 27 degrees Fahrenheit through 2100 in order to limit climate impacts on small island countries and other vulnerable nations. In Trumps discussion with the Times Trump said he is also keeping his mind open about whether global warming is mainly due to human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels or other causes. Scientists of course settled this matter long ago with the debate within the climate community now focused on just how severe the consequences of human caused climate change will be rather than whether the phenomenon exists in the first place. Through his personnel decisions Trump has given every indication that he plans to gut environmental regulations and boost fossil fuel production including coal which is the most carbon intensive fuel source. Environmental groups are skeptical that Trumps statements on Tuesday represent much of a change. Actions speak louder than words said 350org executive director Mary Boeve in a statement. As long as Trump has a climate change denier like Myron Ebell running his transition team you know this is all a bunch of empty rhetoric. Trump is going on about fantasies like clean coal and flip flopping around on whether there is some connectivity between humans and climate change. The President elect needs to get up to speed and fast. Michael Brune the executive director of the Sierra Club pointed to Trumps shortlist for cabinet positions dealing with climate issues such as oil tycoon Harold Hamm for Energy Secretary as evidence there is not much of a shift taking place. we are waiting for action and Trump is kidding nobody on climate as he simultaneously stacks his transition team and cabinet with climate science deniers and the dirtiest hacks the fossil fuel industry can offer Brune said. Prove it President elect. The world is watching

1067,Islamic State has turned its hand to human organ trafficking to fund terror across the Middle East it has been claimed. The jihadist group has until now filled its 2million a year war chest from a variety of shadowy sources including oil production human trafficking and drug smuggling. But it was revealed today that it has been recruiting foreign doctors for months to harvest the internal organs not only from the bodies of their own dead fighters but also from living hostages including children snatched from minority communities in Iraq and Syria. Scroll down for video Lucrative The terror organisation even set up a specialist organ smuggling division whose sole responsibility is to sell human hearts livers and kidneys on the lucrative international black market Evil The jihadist group has until now filled its 2million a year war chest through a variety of shadowy sources including oil production human trafficking and drug smuggling. The shocking news was revealed in a report by al Monitor news website citing an Iraqi ear nose and throat doctor named Siruwan al Mosuli. He told the site that IS commanders have hired foreign doctors to run an extensive organ trafficking system from a hospital in the captured city of Mosul northern Iraq that is already beginning to generate huge profits.

Most of the organs are then smuggled out of Syria and Iraq into neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia or Turkey where criminal gangs sell them on to shady buyers across the globe the Assyrian International News Agency reported. While organ harvesting may be the most shocking of IS revenue streams the report highlights a string of others that contribute to the groups 2million annual income. One tactic is smuggling families and individuals into other countries. The report highlights one instance when a family paid ISIS over 8000 per individual to sneak them into Turkey.

Al Monitors report claims that IS traffics Afghan heroin into Europe from the city of Nineveh which the Russian Federal Drug Control Service says is generating significant revenues. Its drug business has become so successful in recent months that the RFDCS claims that IS now supplies half of Europes entire heroin market.

However crude oil still remains IS biggest earner pulling in more then 1million per day as it is produced from oil refineries captured in besieged towns
2100,The man behind the world famous 50ft Crabzilla spotted lurking beneath the waters in Whitstable has described the furore caused by the colossal crustacean as a bit of fun. Quinton Winter of Station Road told KentOnline he was stunned by the amount of coverage the sea monster has clawed after it appeared at his exhibition at the Horsebridge Centre. Aerial images of the shadowy figure emerged on the artists bizarre blog Weird Whitstable – which documents supernatural sightings across the town. Artist Quinton Winter This week it was splashed on the Daily Star front page with the story also featuring in worldwide news outlets including Australia Malaysia and France. But despite its popularity with the global media the tale left online readers feeling rather crabby with criticisms it was juvenile. Quinton said When I saw the picture I thought I could use it in my exhibition. I thought it may have been a sand formation but it looked like a crab to me. I am not trying to lie about anything it is just a bit of fun. KM Group graphic artist Ashley Austen took a sceptical view of the paranormal find. Crabzilla was spotted off the coast of WhitstableCrabzilla was spotted lurking beneath the water He said The image of the giant crab can be quite easily recreated in Photoshop. All the artist had to do is find a suitable image of a crab overlay it on to the satellite picture of the harbour and apply a few filters. But Mr Winter said he did not think the image would be taken too seriously. He said Sometimes you put stuff out there and no one takes any notice and then sometimes unexpectedly it goes everywhere. It has been a strange reaction. I do not think anyone seriously believes there actually is a 50ft crab in Whitstable. What would it feast on. Fat juicy Londoners. Quinton Winter I do not think anyone seriously believes there actually is a 50ft crab in Whitstable. What would it feast on. Fat juicy Londoners.

According to the Marine Biological Association the largest species is the Japanese spider crab which can grow up to 37m across the size of a small car. Other strange sightings reported by Weird Whitstable include a haunted fence in Tankerton

According to The Independent Argentinas president President Christina Fernández de Kirchner adopted a boy named Yair Tawil as her godson so that he would not turn into a werewolf. it is actually part of a longstanding tradition in the country that dates back to a folk story in the country According to Argentinian folklore the seventh son born to a family turns into the feared el lobison. The werewolf like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boys 13th birthday the legend says turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form. As well as feeding on excrement unbaptized babies and the flesh of the recently dead the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite. Because some people actually believed this hundreds of years ago they started killing babies. So to stop that from happening presidents starting adopting the seventh born boys of families. The practice was later extended to include girls too. Now seventh born children not only get the countrys president as their new godparent they also get a gold medal and a scholarship. According to The Jewish Telegraphic Agency Tawil is also the first Jewish boy to participate in the adoption tradition Shlomo and Nehama Tawil parents of seven boys in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree and asking for the designation of godson. On Tuesday he became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentinas history. Fernandez received Yair his parents and three of his brothers in her office where they lit Hanukkah candles together. The president in her tweets and photos described to her 34 million Twitter followers a magical moment with a marvelous family. She described Yair as a total sweety and his mother a Queen Esther
1705,CAMP EDWARDS The three Afghanistan National Army officers who went missing during a training exercise at a Cape Cod military base on Saturday were located Monday afternoon near the Canadian border. CBS Boston reports that the three soldiers were taken into custody early Monday afternoon attempting to cross the Canadian border. Lt Col James Sahady of the Massachusetts National Guard said earlier Monday there were no details to report on the search. US military officials said the Afghan soldiers had been participating in a US Central Command Regional Cooperation training exercise in peacekeeping at Joint Base Cape Cod. They arrived at Camp Edwards on Sept 11 and were last seen Saturday at the Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis an off day for the program. The soldiers were reporting missing by base security personnel on Saturday night. They were identified as Maj Jan Mohammad Arash Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Capt. Noorullah Aminyar. The State Department Central Command Massachusetts State Police and local police were involved in a search for the soldiers. The soldiers who are in the country on visas were at the mall at a chaperoned event to introduce them to American culture according to a CentCom official when they disappeared. Pentagon officials told CBS News the officers were not required to surrender their passports so they could still have them. Local law enforcement officials were given photos of the soldiers. The Afghan soldiers posed no threat to the public military officials said. The Regional Cooperation training exercises have been held annually since 2004 to promote cooperation and interoperability among forces build functional capacity practice peacekeeping operations and enhance readiness. This years exercise which involves more than 200 participants from six nations including the US wraps up Wednesday. There are about a dozen more Afghan soldiers still participating in the exercise. Military officials from Tajikistan Pakistan Kazakhstan and Mongolia are also participants. Earlier this month two Afghan police officers who were training with the DEA vanished while on a trip to Washington. The police officers were located in Buffalo. CBS affiliate WIVB in Buffalo reports the police officer duo told officials they just wanted a better life. They will be returning to Afghanistan. © 2014 CBS Interactive Inc All Rights Reserved.

28,In designing its first wearable device in the Apple Watch Apple looked to incorporate a variety of highly advanced health functions with an eye on creating a holistic monitoring device but ultimately scrapped those plans due to technological and regulatory hurdles. According to The Wall Street Journal sources claim Apple Watch was supposed to be much more than the device unveiled last year and slated to launch in April. Specifically Apple executives wanted to produce a cutting edge health monitoring tool one capable of measuring a users blood pressure heart rate stress level and more said people familiar with the matter. The publication says the setbacks forced Apple executives into a corner when it came to marketing the device to the general consumer. As it stands Apple Watch boasts a variety of sensors including accelerometers touch inputs and a bespoke optical heart rate sensor the latter of which connects to the iOS Health app for fitness and wellness tracking. While polished and presented in a slick package Apple Watch is powered by technology on a par with competing devices running flavors of Android. Aside from catchall smartwatch devices a number of standalone solutions for off the shelf medical style monitoring already exist in the form of products — usually wrist worn — from smaller manufacturers and startups. For example the WMe band incorporates a specialized sensor to measure a users autonomic nervous system for keeping track of stress levels while the latest products from Fitbit tout all day heart rate monitoring. Apple started development of its Watch four years ago with an eye on health and fitness but the project was quickly dubbed a black hole for sucking in resources. Advanced technology and component reliability failed to meet Apples rigorous standards sources said. For example skin conductivity sensors showed promise in early designs but later testing showed actual results varied person to person with everything from hairy arms to strap tightness contributing to unreliable readings. The company also investigated incorporating blood pressure and blood oxygen measurement features but results were inconsistent. Apple is seemingly investing on health minded devices and programs as evidenced by recently discovered job postings but will take a more mainstream approach for the first generation Watch. Instead of focusing exclusively on health and fitness the device is being positioned as a niche filling fashion accessory iOS compatible smartwatch iPhone companion and daily communicator among others. Apple Watch does however sport a few Apple only features including Apple Pay integration and WatchKit development tools that are expected to foster a rich ecosystem of bite sized apps later this year

Leung the citys Beijing backed leader while shielding faces from the gas HSBC and Standard Chartered shut bank branches in Hong Kong as Hang Seng stock market fell to two month low Chinese riot police were forced into an embarrassing back down today as they withdrew from the streets of Hong Kong amid fury over their heavy handed use of tear gas to disperse anti democracy protesters. Tens of thousands of people mainly students have brought central Hong Kong to a standstill blocking roads and forcing the closure of banks and schools in a major pushback against Beijings decision to limit democratic reforms. The uprising is fast becoming known as the Umbrella Revolution due to the fact that protesters are using little more than parasols to protect themselves against the volleys of tear gas being fired at them by police in an unprecedented crack down on dissent leaving many choking under thick clouds of toxic vapour. The protesters have in turn countered with the hands up do not shoot gesture first employed last month by demonstrators in Ferguson Missouri as they marched over the police shooting of unarmed black teenager Mike Brown. There the gesture became a symbol of the fight against racism and police violence in America. Scroll down for video Hands up do not shoot Protesters have responded to the governments use of tear gas by using the hands up do not shoot gesture first employed by demonstrators in Ferguson Missouri last month as they marched over the police shooting of unarmed black teenager Mike Brown Toxic fumes Fury continues to grow over the polices heavy handed attempts to disperse protesters including the widespread use of tear gas Appropriation Protesters in Hong Kong have appropriated the gesture which came to symbolise the fight against racism and police violence in America as a symbol of democracy and freedom Their use of the gesture has been hailed as a sign of how plugged in to world affairs Hong Kongers are despite the mainland governments attempts to stifle social media and other information gathering tools And this morning the Chinese government announced that riot police had been taken off the streets as citizens have mostly calmed down and urged people to unblock roads and disperse. Instead the government switched its focus to social media banning Instagram across the country in a further bid to stifle dissent in the Asian financial hub. The popular photo sharing service was shut down today in an apparent attempt to prevent demonstrators sharing photographs of the upheaval with their countrymen as they expanded their rallies throughout Hong Kong. Many photos already posted on the image sharing website labelled under the hashtag OccupyCentral a phrase officials went on to block from Weibo Chinas version of Twitter.

An officer with a bullhorn tried to get them to clear the way for the commuters. A protester using the groups own speaker system responded by saying that they wanted Hong Kongs Chief Executive Leung Chun ying to demand a genuine choice for the territorys voters. Do something good for Hong Kong. We want real democracy. he shouted. As the mayhem continued London based banks HSBC and Standard Chartered were today forced to shut bank branches in Hong Kong as the territorys political unrest spills into the financial markets as the Hang Seng stock market to fall 2 per cent to a two month low. Meanwhile the Foreign Office confirmed it is carefully monitoring the situation with a spokesman saying the British Government was concerned about the events there and highlighted peoples right to protest.

It is important for Hong Kong to preserve these rights and for Hong Kong people to exercise them within the law. These freedoms are best guaranteed by the transition to universal suffrage. We hope that the upcoming consultation period will produce arrangements which allow a meaningful advance for democracy in Hong Kong and we encourage all parties to engage constructively in discussion to that end.

The clashes images of which have been beamed around the world are undermining Hong Kongs image as a safe financial haven and raised the stakes of the face off against President Xi Jinpings government. Beijing has taken a hard line against threats to the Communist Partys monopoly on power including clamping down on dissidents and Muslim Uighur separatists in the countrys far west. The mass protests are the strongest challenge yet to Beijings decision last month to reject open nominations for candidates under proposed guidelines for the first ever elections for Hong Kongs leader promised for 2017. Instead candidates must continue to be hand picked by Beijing a move that many residents viewed as reneging on promises to allow greater democracy in the semi autonomous territory. With rumours swirling the Beijing backed and deeply unpopular Leung reassured the public that speculation that the Chinese army might intervene was untrue. I hope the public will keep calm. do not be misled by the rumors. Police will strive to maintain social order including ensuring smooth traffic and ensuring the public safety Leung said.

Protesters also occupied streets in other parts of Hong Kong Island including the upscale shopping area of Causeway Bay as well as across the harbor in densely populated Mong Kok on the Kowloon peninsula. The citys transport department said roads in those areas were closed. More than 200 bus routes have been canceled or diverted in a city dependent on public transport. Subway exits have also been closed or blocked near protest area. Authorities said some schools in areas near the main protest site would be closed. Leung urged people to go home obey the law and avoid causing trouble. We do not want Hong Kong to be messy he said as he read a statement that was broadcast early Monday. Arrests While police have dispersed many of the protesters there are still thousands from the Occupy Central group gathered in the citys financial district Protest It is believed that the citys financial district will try to operate as normal tomorrow despite thousands of protesters camped in the street Crowd control Riot police prepare to defend the Hong Kong government complex although it was later reported that some protesters had made it inside Standoff Protesters have now erected barricades in the centre of Hong Kong and are preparing to settle in for the night as riot police surround them Unrest The night of demonstrations follows on from clashes between activists and police yesterday when students charged through a cordon and broke into the Hong Kong government complex That came hours after police lobbed canisters of tear gas into the crowd on Sunday evening. The searing fumes sent demonstrators fleeing though many came right back to continue their protest. The government said 26 people were taken to hospitals. To ward off tear gas demonstrators improvised with homemade defenses such as plastic wrap which they used to cover their face and arms as well as umbrellas goggles and surgical masks. The protests began with a class boycott last week by students urging Beijing to grant genuine democratic reforms to this former British colony. This is a long fight business and law student Edward Yau 19 said overnight. The government has to understand that we have the ability to undo it if they continue to treat us like we are terrorists.

It also promised the citys leader would eventually be chosen through universal suffrage. Hong Kongs residents have long felt their city stood apart from mainland China thanks to those civil liberties and separate legal and financial systems. Beijings insistence on using a committee to screen candidates on the basis of their patriotism to China similar to the one that currently hand picks Hong Kongs leaders has stoked fears among pro democracy groups that Hong Kong will never get genuine democracy. University students began their class boycotts over a week ago and say they will continue them until officials meet their demands for reforming the local legislature and withdrawing the proposal to screen election candidates. Students and activists had been camped out since late Friday on streets outside the government complex. Sundays clashes arose when police sought to block thousands of people from entering the protest zone. Protesters spilled onto a busy highway bringing traffic to a standstill.

Thousands of people breached a police cordon Sunday as they tried to join the sit in spilling out onto a busy highway and bringing traffic to a standstill. Although students started the rally leaders of the broader Occupy Central civil disobedience movement joined them early Sunday saying they wanted to kick start a long threatened mass sit in demanding Hong Kongs top leader be elected without Beijings interference. Occupy Central issued a statement Monday calling on Leung to resign and saying his non response to the peoples demands has driven Hong Kong into a crisis of disorder. The statement added that the protest was now a spontaneous movement of all Hong Kong people. Police said they had arrested 78 people. They also took away several pro democracy legislators who were among the demonstrators but later released them. A police statement said the officers have exercised restraint and performed their duties in a highly professional manner. It urged the public to not occupy roads so that emergency vehicles can get through. Among the dozens arrested was 17 year old Joshua Wong who was dragged away soon after he led a group of students storming the government complex. Wong is a leader of the activist group Scholarism which organized protests two years ago that forced the government to drop proposed Chinese national curriculum guidelines seen as brainwashing. He was released Sunday evening. Powerful images. Thoughts with the people of Hong K

1248,Looks like he used up all his nine lives. A cat in Florida that was hit by a car and then buried is apparently back from the dead. I was so shocked owner Ellis Hutson told ABC News. I did not know really what to do. And today Bart the cat is having surgery at the Humane Society to repair his jaw and remove his eye. Meet the Guy Delivering Food to Snowed In New Yorkers Unleashed Polar Bear Delights Residents We have seen many amazing cases at our full service veterinary clinic but this situation may take the cake the Humane Society of Tampa said on its website. The cats owner Hutson 52 said he found Bart the cat two weeks ago in the middle of the road lifeless in a puddle of blood. Hutson said he asked his friend to help bury the 23 month old cat because the landscaper was so distraught after losing a companion he is had since he was a kitten. We were so close I could not stand to bury him Hutson said. I put him on the shoulder of the road and went and got David. He dug a hole and covered up the cat with dirt. I witnessed him bury the cat. Five days later the cat showed up in a neighbors yard alive but weak dehydrated and in need of medical attention. I open the door and my neighbors standing there with the cat in her hand Hutson said. She said Bart is not dead. I said that is impossible. We buried Bart. Bart has been treated for a broken jaw open facial wounds and a ruined eye. The Humane Society veterinarians expect him to recover and be able to return home after recovering a couple days. This is unbelievable. I do not have any explanation for it Hutson said. Hutson said he will pay for the surgery costs for the cat. The total cost for the care of Bart including todays surgery and post operative care will be around 2000 the Humane Society said. Hutsons neighbor Dusty Albritton started a GoFundMe page to raise money for the cats medical expenses. I saw him with my own eyes. I know he was dead. He was cold and stiff Albritton told ABC News. Albrittons cat died the same day with similar injuries. We figured he was hit by the same car she said. Now my kids believe their cat will also rise from the dead she said with a chuckle. But I told them I do not think so. When she discovered the resurrected Bart she said he acted like he is in no pain whatsoever. The only thing I can think of is that this is Gods miracle. And I thought why five days later. If Bart was alive before he would have come to our homes earlier. All I can think of is that God created animal life on the fifth day. Bart was a kitten from Hutsons girlfriends cat. He said this has been an emotional ordeal for him and his girlfriend but he has not tried explaining the situation to his two year old daughter. As a two year old she does not understand any of this either he said
2339,The ISIS terror group has published a video titled A second message to America showing the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff. The video also threatens the life of British captive David Haines. Sotloff speaks to the camera before he is killed saying he is paying the price for US intervention. The masked ISIS figure in the video speaks to US President Barack Obama telling him Just as your missiles continue to strike our people our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people. Last week Sotloffs mother Shirley Sotloff released a video pleading with ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi not to kill her son. Steven is a journalist who traveled to the Middle East to cover the suffering of Muslims at the hands of tyrants. Steven is a loyal and generous son brother and grandson she said. He is an honorable man and has always tried to help the weak. Sotloff appeared last month in an ISIS video showing the decapitation of another American journalist James Foley. The militant in the video warned that Sotloffs fate depended on what President Barack Obama did next in Iraq. Steven Sotloff disappeared while reporting from Syria in August 2013 but his family kept the news secret fearing harm to him if they went public. Out of public view the family and a number of government agencies have been trying to gain Sotloffs release for the past year. Sotloff 31 grew up in South Florida with his mother father and younger sister. He majored in journalism at the University of Central Florida. His personal Facebook page lists musicians like the Dave Matthews Band Phish Miles Davis and movies like Lawrence of Arabia and The Big Lebowski as favorites. On his Twitter page he playfully identifies himself as a stand up philosopher from Miami. In 2004 Sotloff left UCF and moved back to the Miami area. He graduated from another college began taking Arabic classes and subsequently picked up freelance writing work for a number of publications including Time Foreign Policy World Affairs and the Christian Science Monitor. His travels took him to Yemen Saudi Arabia Qatar and Turkey among other countries and eventually Syria
1566,FERGUSON Mo. — A pregnant woman lost her eye during protests in Ferguson early Tuesday morning after a St Louis County Police officer fired a bean bag round at the car she was in shattering the glass on the passenger side window. Dornella Conner told KMOV TV that she and her boyfriend DeAngelas Lee were at a gas station early Tuesday morning during the protests following a grand jury decision not to indict Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson in the Aug 9 shooting death of Michael Brown. Conners claims that they were trying to drive around the officers cars but they blocked them in. They pulled up while we were coming towards the street. DeAngelas was trying to get away. They blocked us from the side front and back Conners told KMOV. Police though tell the station that Lee was driving his car toward them and that is when an officer fired a bean bag round at the car which shattered the passenger side glass where Conner was sitting. I did not have any weapons. I was not looting or anything. I was just out with my boyfriend and we were just riding around and respecting Mike Brown Conners said. Conner sought medical attention from another police officer before she was taken to a hospital. The shattered glass left her blind in her left eye. I am very upset and very disappointed with tactics that they used on trying to get control of the situation that was going Donnell Conner Dornellas father told KMOV. I understand it is a tough job I understand that it was chaos but there was no reason to fire upon an innocent person that is sitting in a vehicle. How can a pregnant person in a car in a seatbelt be causing chaos. Dornella Conner took to Facebook to thank her family and friends for their support. I am blind in my left eye and they took it out because I got shot in my face so I can only see in my right eye but thank God that i can see the world and still alive she wrote. I am in a lot of pain but I am ok KMOV reports that an arrest warrant has been issued for Lee and a bond has been set at 50000. Sixteen people were arrested on the gas station lot located on the 10000 block of Halls Ferry Road on Tuesday. Despite the violence this week protesters in Ferguson pressed pause Thursday as the city welcomed Thanksgiving decorating boarded up storefronts with some Dr Seuss inspiration and gathering for church services — a stark contrast to previous days of outrage over the grand jury decision in the Michael Brown case. No police officers or Missouri National Guard members stood sentry outside the Ferguson police station which has been a nexus for protesters since Monday nights announcement On that downtown street beneath a lighted Seasons Greetings garland three children used paintbrushes to decorate the plywood covering many storefront windows that was put up to foil potential vandals. One quoted from The Lorax by Dr Seuss Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot nothing is going to get better it is not. We thought we had do what we could to make it a little more attractive and then try to bring the kids into it and get them involved in making the businesses appear a little less scary depressing said Leah Bailey as her 7 year old son Dennis climbed a ladder to finish an orange dragon. Several hours after dark a few people continued painting but there was no visible protest activity. National Guard troops occasionally patrolled the area and surrounding neighborhoods in vehicles and on foot. Since the grand jurys decision protests have taken place across the country. Most have been peaceful. But at least 130 demonstrators who refused to disperse during a Los Angeles protest were arrested Wednesday night while 35 people were detained in Oakland following a march that deteriorated into unrest and vandalism according to police officials. Back in Ferguson Greater St Mark Family Church sits blocks from where several stores went up in flames after the grand jury announcement. A handful of people listened to the Rev. Tommie Pierson preach Thursday that the destruction and chaos was by a small group of out of control people out there. They do not represent the community they do not represent the mood nor the feelings of the community Pierson said. I would imagine if you talked to them they probably do not even live here. So we do not want to be defined by what they did. In downtown St Louis a group gathered near Busch Stadium for what organizer Paul Byrd called a pro community car rally meant to be peaceful and counter the recent Ferguson violence he suggested has tarnished the regions image. Byrd a 45 year old construction worker from Imperial Missouri declined to say whether he supported Wilson but noted I totally support police officers. The cruise was escorted by a city police vehicle no protesters showed up
1238,British jihadist al Britani has reportedly been killed in Syria
914,Nope. Argentinas President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner has not become godmother of a Jewish baby to stop him from becoming a werewolf – despite what you may have read in multiple news reports. Over the past few days the story has been reported and unquestioningly re reported across the echo chamber of the internet picked up by news organisations around the world including Haaretz Buzzfeed The Independent and The Huffington Post. Like all good urban myths the articles were based on a grain of truth by tradition the seventh son born to an Argentine family is eligible to become the godson of the president. Until this month the honour had only been bestowed on Christian babies but on Wednesday Iair Tawil – not a baby but the strapping 21 year old son of a rabbi – became the countrys first Jewish presidential godson. In her Twitter account Kirchner described Tawil 21 as completely sweet and lit Hanukkah candles with his family. Tenía razón. Me trajeron de regalo un candelabro de Israel. Me pidieron que encendiera las velas… pictwittercomDVWewmZera Yo no lo sabía pero su visita coincidía con la celebración de Hanukkah. El papá decía que no era una casualidad… pictwittercomo3y5E17Gew But somehow the story became entangled with the ancient legend of the lobizón. According to some versions of the myth the seventh son of the seventh son is particularly prone to fall victim to the curse. Evidently the chance meeting of a Latin American president with a colourful myth too good to fact check proved irresistible – confirming as it did any number of stereotypes about erratic behaviour from national leaders in the continent of magical realism. But according to Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda there is no link between the two traditions. The local myth of the lobizón is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president he said. That custom began in 1907 when Enrique Brost and Apolonia Holmann Volga German emigrés from south eastern Russia asked then president José Figueroa Alcorta to become godfather to their seventh son said the historian. The couple wanted to maintain a custom from Czarist Russia where the Tsar was said to become godfather to seventh sons and Argentinas president accepted. The practice soon became tradition and was passed into law in 1974 by Isabel Perón the widow of Argentinas political strongman General Juan Perón once she succeeded him in the presidential seat after his death in office.

In Catholic Argentina large familes are not uncommon over 120000 families had seven of more children at last count in 2006. Not all qualify to become presidential god children as the honour is only given to those in which seven sons are born consecutively with no daughters in between. The president with most godsons was Juan Perón who had 1982 over three terms in office. He is followed by another Peronist former president Carlos Menem who had 1136 during the 1990s. Fernández has become presidential godmother to some 700 children since taking office in 2007. Earlier this year she set another precedent by making the the daughter of a lesbian couple the first presidential godchild
